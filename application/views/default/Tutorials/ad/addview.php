                        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
                        <p>Diarrhea is one of the most common diagnoses in clinical practice. It affects all age groups. Most of the deaths associated with diarrheal illness occur in the very young and the elderly populations, whose health may be put at risk from a moderate amount of dehydration.</p>
                        <p>According to the World Health Organization, two million children die each year in developing countries from diarrhea. This makes diarrhea the second most serious killer of children under five, worldwide.</p>
                        <p>Diarrhea can however in most cases be prevented or treated. Correct management of diarrhea could save the lives of up to 90% of children and many adults, who currently die  from  the  effects  of  the  disease.</p>
                        <p>Acute diarrhea is caused by many different agents including parasites, bacteria and viruses, the latter of which have been given significant attention in recent years.</p>
                        <h2>DIARRHOEA</h2>
                        <h2 class="underline">Normal bowel frequency</h2>
                        <p>For most individuals, normal daily stool weight ranges between 100 and 200 grams. Normal  bowel  frequency  ranges  from  3  times  a  day  to  3  times  a  week.</p>
                        <h2 class="underline">Diarrhoea</h2>
                        <p>Diarrhoea is defined as an increase in daily stool weight above 200 grams.</p>
                        <p>In clinical practice, the term is used to describe increased liquidity of the stools, usually associated with increased stool weight and frequency (more than 3 times per day) Pseudo-diarrhea or hyper-defecation represents increased frequency of defecation without an  increase  in  stool  weight  above  normal,  as  seen  in  irritable  bowel  syndrome  or hyperthyroidism.</p>
                        <h2 class="underline">Different types of diarrhoea</h2>
                        <p>Diarrhoea can be classified based on different  factors  such  as:</p>
                        <ul class="fist-menu">
                            <li>Duration of the illness - <b>acute</b>  versus  <b>chronic</b></li>
                            <li>Pathophysiological mechanisms - <b>osmotic</b> versus  <b>secretory</b></li>
                            <li>Severity - <b>less</b> versus <b>more</b></li>
                            <li>Stool characteristics - <b>watery, fatty,</b> or <b>bloody</b></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In clinical practice, duration of the illness and stool characteristics are most useful in the evaluation and treatment of patients with Diarrhoea.</p>
                        <h2 class="underline">Acute diarrhoea</h2>
                        <p>Acute diarrhea is defined as a diarrheal illness lasting for less than 4 weeks. If the illness  persists  for  more  than  4  weeks,  it  is  considered  chronic  diarrhoea.</p>
                        <h2 class="underline">Causes of Acute Diarrhoea</h2>
                        <p>The most  common  causes  of  acute  diarrhoea  are:</p>
                        <ul class="fist-menu">
                            <li>Infectious agents- viruses, bacteria and parasites [Infectious Diarrhoea]</li>
                            <li>Food poisoning- preformed toxins</li>
                            <li>Medications</li>
                            <li>Inflammatory or  ischemic  bowel  disease</li>
                            <li>Fecal impaction</li>
                            <li>Recent ingestion of poorly absorbable sugars e.g., lactulose</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2 class="underline">There  are  4  mechanisms  of  diarrhea:</h2>
                        <h2>1.  Osmotic  Diarrhoea</h2>
                        <p>This type of diarrhoea is due to the presence of an unabsorbable or poorly absorbable solute that exerts an osmotic pressure effect across the intestinal mucosa, resulting in excessive water output. Because the diarrhea is caused by the solute, it tends to stop  during  fasting.</p>
                        <p>Causes of osmotic diarrhoea include disaccharidase deficiency (lactose intolerance), malabsorption, poorly absorbed sugars (lactulose, sorbitol, mannitol), laxatives (magnesium, sodium citrate, sodium phosphate), and magnesium-containing antacids.</p>
                        <h2>2.  Secretory Diarrhoea</h2>
                        <p>In this type of diarrhoea there is abnormal ion transport across the intestinal epithelial cells, which results in increased secretion, decreased absorption, or both. As the diarrhoea is not related to intestinal contents, it typically does not stop with fasting.</p>
                        <p>A classic example of acute secretory diarrhea is cholera, but it is also seen in infections like enterotoxigenic E coli.</p>
                        <h2>3.  Altered Motility</h2>
                        <p>Abnormal motility (increased/decreased) can cause diarrhoea by the following mechanisms:</p>
                        <h2>4.  Exudative  Diarrhoea</h2>
                        <p>Extensive injury of the small bowel or colon mucosa may result in fluid and protein loss into the intestinal lumen and ensuring diarrhoea. Exudation is rarely the only mechanism  accounting  for  diarrhoea.</p>
                        <p>Causes  of  exudative  diarrhoea  include  invasive  bacterial  infections  (Shigella, Salmonella) and inflammatory bowel disease.</p>
                        <p><b>It is important to note that more than one mechanism may coexist. For example, in infectious and inflammatory conditions, malabsorption leading to osmotic diarrhoea  and  active  secretion  can  coexist.</b></p>
                        <h2 class="underline">Diarrhoea and the enteric nervous system</h2>
                        <p>The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the fluid losses seen in different types of diarrhea have been debated for decades. The dominating hypothesis up to the 1970s was that most diarrheas, including the infectious, were caused by motility disturbances. However, during the last three decades it has been become increasingly evident that disturbances in the epithelial transport are often one of the major causes of intestinal fluid loss,  although  motility  may  contribute,  at  least  in  some  types  of  diarrhoea.</p>
                        <p>Studies on conscious neonatal mice with rotavirus diarrhoea showed that nerve blockers decreased diarrhoea. Subsequent studies in vitro confirmed that neurotransmitter blockers inhibit fluid secretion in the intestine. Opiates have been known to inhibit intestinal fluid and electrolyte secretion as well as gut motility. The endogenous opiates, enkephalins, are found in enteric nerves as neurotransmitters. Studies demonstrated that these enkephalins reduce fluid secretion in the gut. Inhibitors of the enzymes encephalinases, which degrade the enkephalins, cause a build up of the enkephalins and enhance their action. In line with this the enkephalinase inhibitor racecadotril has been shown to attenuate acute diarrhea in children and adults. Salazar-Lindo et al. have recently shown in a clinical trail that racecadotril markedly inhibited stool output in young Peruvian children with rotavirus diarrhoea.</p>
                        <h2 class="underline">Enkephalins</h2>
                        <p>Enkephalins are of two types: leu-enkephalin and met-enkephalin. Enkephalins occur in the brain and spinal cord and also in the gastrointestinal tract. They have potent opiate-like  effects  and  probably  serve  as  neurotransmitters.</p>
                        <h2 class="underline">Role of Enkephalinase</h2>
                        <p>Enkephalinase is a cell membrane peptidase enzyme located in various tissues, notably the epithelium of the small intestine. This enzyme contributes both to the digestion of exogenous peptides and to the breakdown of endogenous peptides such as enkephalins, neurokinin and substance P.</p>
                        <h2 class="underline">Symptoms and signs of diarrhoea</h2>
                        <p>Patients with diarrhoea, present with various clinical features depending on the underlying cause.</p>
                        <p>Diarrhoea due to small-intestinal disease is typically high-volume, watery, and often associated with malabsorption and dehydration is frequent. Diarrhoea due to colonic involvement is more often associated with frequent small-volume stools, with the presence of blood  and  a  sensation  of  urgency.</p>
                        <p>Patients with acute infectious diarrhoea typically present with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, and frequent stools, which may be watery, malabsorptive or bloody depending on the specific pathogen. In general, small-intestinal pathogens are noninvasive, and ileocolonic pathogens are more likely to be invasive.</p>
                        <p><b>Giardiasis</b> may be associated with mild steatorrhea, gaseousness and bloating.</p>
                        <h2 class="underline">Treatment for diarrhoea</h2>
                        <p>The principal components of the treatment of acute diarrhoea are fluid and electrolyte replacement,  dietary  modifications  and  drug  therapy.</p>
                        <h2 class="underline">Rehydration</h2>
                        <p>If patients are otherwise healthy and do not have dehydration, adequate fluid intake can be achieved with soft drinks, fruit juice, broth, soup and salted biscuits. In those with excessive fluid losses and dehydration, more aggressive measures like intravenous fluids or oral rehydration therapy with isotonic, electrolyte solutions containing glucose or starch should be given.</p>
                        <h2 class="underline">Antidiarrheal Agents</h2>
                        <p>These can be very useful in amelioration of symptoms and include opioid derivatives like loperamide, diphenoxylate-atropine and tincture of opium. Bismuth subsalicylate is another useful agent, but it is contraindicated in HIV-infected patients since it may cause bismuth encephalopathy. The antimotility agents should not be used in febrile dysentery patients (e.g., those infected by Shigella), as these agents may prolong the disease.</p>
                        <h2 class="underline">Antimicrobial Therapy</h2>
                        <p>Because the majority of patients have mild, self-limited disease due to viruses or noninvasive bacteria, empiric treatment of all patients is not warranted. Empiric treatment is indicated in those patients with suspected invasive bacterial infection, traveler’s diarrhoea, or immunosuppression.</p>

                        <p>Racecadotril is a lipophilic diesterified prodrug of the enkephalinase inhibitor <b>thiorphan</b>. It  is the  first  and  only  enkephalinase  inhibitor  in  its  class.</p>
                        <h2 class="underline">Mode of action of Racecadotril</h2>
                        <p>In peripheral tissues, orally administered racecadotril is rapidly hydrolyzed to the more potent enkephalinase inhibitor thiorphan. Within these tissues, membrane-bound enkephalinase enzymes degrade endogenous opioids (enkephalins). Thiorphan (racecadotril) is thought to inhibit enkephalinase. By inhibiting this enzyme, thiorphan (racecadotril) prevents the inactivation of endogenous enkephalins and prolongs their physiological action. The enkephalins act as neurotransmitters in the gastrointestinal tract by activating ä-opiate receptors and thus reducing the level of cyclic AMP. The result is reduced secretion of water and electrolytes into the intestinal lumen without any detectable effect on intestinal motility. Racecadotril has antisecretory actions only when hypersecretion is present and not in the basal state.</p>

                        <h2>DIGESTIVE   TRACT   SYSTEM</h2>
                        <h2>FUNCTION OF DIGESTIVE TRACT SYSTEM</h2>
                        <p>Food is masticated in the mouth by teeth & mixed with saliva from the salivary gland. The food (bolus) then travels through the esophagus to the stomach. The muscular ring, Upper Oesophageal Sphincter, allow the swallowed food in, and closes it to keep air out, moves the food in a sequence of muscular contractions called peristalsis.</p>
                        <p>The Lower Esophageal Sphincter (LES) passes the food and closes it to prevent gastric reflux. All the sphincters located in the digestive tract help the digested food to move in one direction. The first stage of protein digestion takes part in the stomach. Rest of the digestion takes part in the  duodenum.</p>
                        <img class="tree-structure2" src="<?php echo base_url().'tutorial/ad/'; ?>assets/images/tree-structure3.jpg" alt="tree-structure3">
                        <p>Absorption of digested food takes place in the small intestine. Water is reabsorbed in the  large intestine  to  give  the  stool  its  consistency.</p>
                        <p>Metabolism  takes  place in  the  liver,  the  largest  gland  in  the  body.</p>
                        <h2>STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF STOMACH</h2>
                        <p>Stomach is a J shaped dilated portion of the alimentary canal situated in the epigastric, umbilical & hypochondriac regions of the abdominal cavity. The function of the Gastro Intestinal Tract is ruled and coordinated by the enteric nervous  system  (ENS).</p>
                        <p>The lower part of the stomach is called the pyloric part. The opening through which food passes from this part into the intestine is called the pyloric orifice of antrum or pylorus. The rounded upper part of the stomach is known as the fundus. The opening of the oesophagus into the stomach is known as cardiac orifice. The middle or main part of the stomach is called the body. The left border of the stomach forms a large curve called the greater curvature. The right border from the entrance of esophagus to the pylorus is much shorter and is known as lesser curvature. At the distal end of the pyloric antrum there is a sphincter which guards the opening between the stomach and duodenum. This is known as pyloric sphincter.</p>

                        <p>This layer consists of loose connective tissue with some elastic fibres. Within this layer there are blood vessels and nerves, lymph vessels & varying amount of lymphoid tissue. The mucous membrane of the stomach is covered with nonciliated columnar epithelium many cells of which secrete mucus, it is continuous with the cells of gastric glands.</p>
                        <p>The gastric glands are innumerable simple or branched tubular glands in the mucous membrane.</p>

This increases of secretion during the presence of emotional stimuli is believed to be one of the factors  in  the  development  of  peptic  ulcers.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2>The phases  of  secretion  of  gastric  juice  are:-</h2>
                        <ul class="fist-menu">
                            <li>Cephalic phase.</li>
                            <li>Gastric phase</li>
                            <li>Intestinal phase</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In Cephalic phase the flow of juice occurs before food reaches stomach. This is due to reflex stimulation of vagus (parasympathetic) nerve. It is initiated by the sight, smell or  taste  of  food.</p>
                        <h2 class="underline">Gastric phase</h2>
                        <p>When stimulated by the presence of food the stomach produces a hormone called gastrin. This hormone stimulates the glands in the wall of stomach to produce more gastric juice. In this way the secretion of digestive juice is continued after the completion of  the  meal  &  the  end  of  the  cephalic  phase.</p>
                        <p>When the partially digested contents of the stomach reach the small intestine a hormone called enterogastrone is produced which slows down the secretion of gastric juice and reduces gastric motility. By slowing the emptying rate of the stomach, the contents of the duodenum become more thoroughly mixed with bile and pancreatic juice. This phase of the gastric secretion is more marked when the meal has had high fat content.</p>
                        <h2>From inside, the gastrointestinal tract is lined by mucous membrane (mucosa)</h2>
                        <ul class="fist-menu">
                            <li>The mucous membrane of the mouth to oesophagus is multilayered and is known as stratified squamous epithelium, while the lining of the stomach and intestines is simply  columnar  with  abundance  of  mucous  secreting  cells.</li>
                            <li>Immediately beneath the epithelium there is structureless connective tissue known as Membrane Propria, followed by another layer called Lamina Propria.</li>
                            <li>A deeper stratum of connective tissue is known as submucosa.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2 class="underline">Parietal Cells</h2>
                        <p>Parietal cells are one of the large peripheral cells of the mucous membrane of the stomach  that  secrete  hydrochloric  acid.  The  parietal  cell  has  three  receptors  :</p>
                        <p>a)   Acetylcholine receptor</p>
                        <p>b)   Histamine receptor (H -receptor),  and</p>
                        <p>c)   Gastrin receptor</p>
                        <h2>GASTRIC HORMONES</h2>
                        <h2 class="underline">Acetlycholine:</h2>
                        <p>Acetylcholine binds to cholinergic-receptors and stimulates parietal cells directly to secrete HCI. Acetylcholine also stimulates parietal cells indirectly by stimulating ECL cells (Enterochromafin-like  cells  or  mast  cells)  to  release  histamine.</p>
                        <h2 class="underline">Histamine:</h2>
                        <p>Histamine is released by the Enterochromafin-like cells (ECL cells). Histamine binds to the H -receptor of the parietal cells to stimulate acid secretion. Histamine release is stimulated by gastrin and acetylcholine.</p>
                        <h2 class="underline">Gastrin:</h2>
                        <p>When there is food in the stomach, the G-cells release gastrin. Gastrin binds to the gastrin receptor in the parietal cell & stimulates it to produce HCI. Gastrin also stimulates ECL cells  to  produce  more  histamine.</p>
                        <h2 class="underline">Basal acid secretion:</h2>
                        <p>Even if there is no stimulation, a certain amount of acid is secreted. This is called basal acid secretion. Basal acid production occurs in a circadian pattern, with highest level occurring in the night and lowest levels during the morning hours.</p>
                        <h2 class="underline">Control of Acid Secretion</h2>
                        <p>As discussed earlier, Parietal cells bear receptors for three stimulators of acid secretion:</p>
                        <ul class="fist-menu">
                            <li>Acetylcholine (muscarinic type receptor)</li>
                            <li>Gastrin</li>
                            <li>Histamine (H   receptor )</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Histamine from enterochromafin-like cells may well be the primary modulator, but the magnitude of the stimulus appears to be a result of a synergistic interaction of signals of each type. Additionally, pharmacologic antagonists of each of these molecules can  block  acid  secretion.</p>
                        <p>Histamine’s effect on the parietal cell is to activate adenylate cyclase, leading to elevation of intracellular cyclic AMP concentrations and activation of protein kinase A (PKA). One effect of PKA activation is phosphorylation of cytoskeletal proteins involved in transport of the H+/K+   ATPase from cytoplasm to plasma membrane. Binding of acetylcholine and gastrin both result in elevation of intracellular calcium concentrations.</p>

                        <p>Stomach  &  Duodenal  ulcers  can  be  treated  with  several  types  of  medications.</p>
                        <h2>1.  Antacids</h2>
                        <p>Neutralises  the  acid  present  in  the  stomach. Although  they  provide  immediate symptomatic  relief,  rebound  hyperacidity  and  tolerance  is  common.</p>
                        <p>E.g. Digene, Policrol, Gelusil</p>
                        <h2>2.  Cytoprotectors</h2>
                        <p>Mucosal protective agents to shield the stomach’s mucous lining from the damage due to  acid,  but  do  not  inhibit  the  release  of  acid.</p>
                        <h2>3.  H2 Receptor Antagonists</h2>
                        <p>Despite some unresolved questions, it is clear that histamine is one of the primary regulators of acid secretion. The parietal cell receptor for histamine is of the H2 type, and antihistamines that engage H1 receptors have no effect on acid secretion. Evidence of histamine’s role in acid secretion is strongly supported by finding that H2 receptor antagonists are quite effective in inhibiting acid secretion. Four primary H2 antagonists have been developed and found clinical utility :</p>
                        <ul class="fist-menu">
                            <li>Cimetidine</li>
                            <li>Ranitidine  (Zinetac,  Histac, Aciloc,  etc.)</li>
                            <li>Famotidine  (Topcid,  Famonite,  Famtac,  etc.)</li>
                            <li>Nizatidine</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2>4.  Proton  Pump  Inhibitors</h2>
                        <p>Acid secretion is absolutely dependent on function of the H+/K+ ATPase or proton pump located in the cannilicular membrane of the parietal cell. Several drugs have been developed that non-competively bind and inactivate the ATPase, resulting in strong inhibition of acid secretion.</p>
                        <p>Omeprazole, </p>

                        <p>The above ingredient in PANTIN enteric-coated tablets is a susbtituted benzimidazole, a  compound  that  inhibits  gastric  acid  secretion.</p>
                        <h2 class="underline">PHARMACODYNAMICS</h2>
                        <h2>Mechanism of Action</h2>
                        <p>Pantoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that suppresses the final step in gastric acid production by forming a covalent bond to two sites of the H+  / K+  ATPase enzyme system at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. This effect is dose- related and leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion irrespective of the stimulus. The binding to the H+  / K+  ATPase results in a duration of antisecretory effect  that  persists  longer  than  24  hours.</p>
                        <h2>Antisecretory Activity</h2>
                        <p>Under maximal acid stimulatory conditions using pentagastrin, a dose- dependent decrease in gastric acid output occurs after a single dose of oral (20-80mg) or a single dose of intravenous (20-120mg) pantoprazole in healthy volunteers. pantoprazole given once daily results in increasing inhibition of gastric acid secretion. Acid secretion had returned to normal within a week after the last dose of pantoprazole; there was no evidence of rebound hypersecretion.</p>
                        <h2 class="underline">PHARMACOKINETICS</h2>
                        <p>PANTIN is an enteric- coated tablet so that absorption of pantoprazole begins only after the tablet leaves the stomach. Peak serum concentration (C) and area under max the serum concentration time curve (AUc) increase in a manner proprotional to oral and intravenous doses from 10mg to 80mg. Pantoprazole does not accumulate and its pharmacokinetics are unaltered with multiple daily dosing. Following oral or intravenous administration, the serum concentration of pantoprazole declines biexponentially with a  terminal  elimination  half-life  of  approximately  one  hour.</p>
                        <p><b>Absorption:</b> The absorption of pantoprazole is rapid, with a C max of 2.5 µg/mL that occurs approximately 2.5 hours after single or multiple oral 40mg doses. Pantoprazole is well absorbed; it undergoes little first-pass metabolism resulting in an absolute bioavailability of approximately 77%. Pantoprazole absorption is not affected by concomitant adminstration of antacids. Pantoprazole may be taken without regard to timing of meals.</p>
                        <p><b>Distribution:</b>  The  apparent  volume  of  distribution  of  pantoprazole  is  approximately 11.0-23.6L, distributing mainly in extracellular fluid. The serum protein binding of pantoprazole is about 98%, primarily to albumin.</p>
                        <p><b>Metabolism:</b> Pantoprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver through the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system. Pantoprazole metabolism is independent of the route of administration (intravenous or oral). Pantoprazole bypass the Phase I metabolism in the liver by Cytocrome  P450.</p>
                        <p><b>Elimination:</b> Approxiamtely 71% of the dose was excreted in the urine with 18% excreted in the faeces through biliary excretion. There was no renal excretion of unchanged pantoprazole.</p>
                        <h2>Special  Populations</h2>
                        <p><b>Geriatric  –</b> No  dosage  adjustment  is  recommended  based  on  age.</p>
                        <p><b>Paediatric –</b> The pharmacokinetics of pantoprazole have not been investigated in patients <  18  years of  age.</p>
                        <p><b>Renal impairment –</b> No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment or in patients undergoing hemodialysis.</p>
                        <p><b>Hepatic impairment –</b> In patients with mild to severe hepatic impairment, maximum pantoprazole concentrations increased only slightly (1.5-fold) relative to healthy subjects.</p>
                        <h2 class="underline">DRUG INTERACTION</h2>
                        <p>Pantoprazole is metabolized through the cytochrome P450 system (Phase II). Therefore no dosage adjustment is needed with concomitant use of the following: theophylline, antipyrine, caffeine, carbamazepine, diazepam, diclofenac, digoxin, ethanol, glyburide, an oral contraceptive, metoprolol, nifedipine, phenytoin, warfarin, midazolam, clarithromycin, metronidazole, or amoxicillin. There was also no interaction with concomitantly administered antacids.</p>

                        <h2>DOMPERIDONE</h2>
                        <h2 class="underline">PHARMACODYNAMICS</h2>
                        <h2>Mechanism of Action:</h2>
                        <p>Domperidone is a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist with antiemetic properties similar to those of metoclopramide and certain neuroleptic medicines. Unlike these medicines, however, domperidone acts peripherally and does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier. It seldom causes extrapyramidal side effects. Its antiemetic effect may be due to a combination of peripheral (gastrokinetic) effects and antagonism of central dopamine receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) which lies in the area postrema and is regarded as being outside the blood-brain barrier.</p>
                        <p>Studies have shown oral domperidone to increase the duration of antral and duodenal contractions, to increase the gastric emptying of liquids and semi-solids in healthy subjects and in patients in whom it was delayed and to increase lower oesophageal sphincter pressure  in  healthy  subjects.  Domperidone  has no  effect  on  gastric  secretion.</p>
                        <h2 class="underline">PHARMACOKINETICS</h2>
                        <h2>Absorption:</h2>
                        <p>Domeridone is rapidly absorbed following oral administration with peak plasma concentrations occurrig at approximately 10 and 30 minutes, respectively. Bioavailability of oral  domperidone  is  13%  to  17%.</p>
                        <h2>Metabolism:</h2>
                        <p>Oral domperidone does not appear to accumulate or induce its own metabolism: a peak plasma level after 90 minutes of 21 ng/mL after two weeks oral administration of  30  mg  per  day  was  almost  the  same  as  that  of  18  ng/mL after  the  first  dose.</p>
                        <p>Domperidone undergoes rapid and extensive hepatic metabolism primarily by cytochrome P-450 involved in the N-dealkylation of domperidone, whereas CYP3A4, CYP1A2 and CYP2E1 are involved in domperidone aromatic hydroxylation.</p>
                        <h2>Distribution</h2>
                        <p>Domperidone is 91% to 93% bound to plasma proteins. Studies have shown wide tissue distribution with low brain concentration. Small amounts of medicine cross the placenta in rats  and  the  medicine  is  excreated  in  the  breast  milk  of  this  species.</p>
                        <h2>Elimination:</h2>
                        <p>Urinary and faecal excretion amounts to 31 and 66%, respectively, of the oral dose. The proportion of the medicine excreted unchanged is small (10% of faecal excretion and approximately 1% of urinary excretion). The plasma half-life after a single oral dose is 7-9 hours in healthy subjects but is prolonged in patients with severe renal insufficiency.</p>
                        <h2 class="underline">INDICATIONS</h2>

                        <p>Pantoprazole  in  PANTIN-D  is  a  potent  and  precise  PPI  and  Domperidone  in PANTIN-D is a proven gastrokinetic. PANTIN-D has a three-pronged attack, which stabilizes gastric acidity, restores LES dysfunction and corrects gastric emptying. Therefore,  in  GASTRITIS,  PANTIN-D  is  the  RIGHT COMBINATION,  RIGHT DOSE.</p>

                        <h2 class="underline">GASTROINTESTINAL MOTILITY</h2>
                        <p>GI motility refers to peristalsis, the smooth muscle contractions that propel digestive contents along the GI tract. Peristaltic motor activity of the gut is an essential activity for digestion and absorption of nutrients to sustain life. These rhythms are critical during and after meals to maximize contact of nutrients with villous surface area for absorption.</p>
                        <p>Motility is controlled by the enteric nervous system (ENS), or “gut brain”, a network of over 100 million neurons embedded in the lining of the GI tract. Although the ENS is influenced by the central brain, it functions independently as a branch of the autonomic nervous system. The neurons within the ENS communicate using many of the neurotransmitters found in the brain; however, their local roles in the GI tract are to regulate smooth muscle activity. The most important regulators of digestive motility are Serotonin, Acetylcholine  &  Dopamine.</p>
                        <p>Dopamine decreases the Acetylcholine level while Serotonin increases Acetylcholine level, therefore dopaminergic and serotonergic activity balances the gut motility.</p>
                        <p>Dopamine is a biogenic amine synthesized in various areas of the central and peripheral nervous system. Dopamine acts as a chemical messenger who affects brain process that control movement, emotional response and ability to experience pleasure and pain. Dopamine, while acting through specific dopaminergic receptors, inhibits lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure and gastroduodenal motility observed from the esophagus to the  colon.</p>
                        <p>Serotonin  is  a  multifarious  neurotransmitter,  with  many  functions.  Excess  amounts of  serotonin  cause  relaxation  and  sedation.  Chemical  name  of  serotonin  is 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). Serotonin is found to have a positive effect in the motor functions of the GI tract. Over 95% of the body’s total serotonin is generated by the GI tract, where it coordinates motility by binding to serotonin type 4 (5 HT) receptors. Once activated, these receptors stimulate the release of acetylcholine into neuromuscular junctions, resulting in coordinated peristalsis, vascular tone and secretion. Serotonin dysfunction is involved in the pathophysiology of a number of functional GI disorders, such as Chronic Constipation, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Diabetic Gastroparesis, Functional Dyspepsia and GERD. 5-HTP supports coordinated motility of the upper and lower GI tract,  in  part  by  supporting  5-HT activity. </p>
                        <p><b>In  the  GI  system  dopamine  delays  gastric  emptying  &  esophageal  motility  as it  inhibits  acetylcholine.</b></p>
                        <p>Although functional GI disorders are not life-threatening diseases, but they are important because the patients with them have a poor quality of life. Symptoms associated with these disorders are often bothersome and prevent those affected from leading full and productive lives.</p>
                        <h2>UPPER-GUT MOTILITY DISORDERS</h2>
                        <h2>1.   FUNCTIONAL DYSPEPSIA:</h2>
                        <p>Dyspepsia is a group of symptoms of the epigastric region including bloating, fullness, early satiety, nausea, belching, vomiting, acid reflux and hyperacidity</p>
                        <p>Dyspepsia can be caused by stress, spicy food & conditions which aggravate excess acid secretion  etc.</p>
                        <p>It is clear that dyspepsia and functional dyspepsia in particular are common conditions globally, affecting most populations, regardless of location. Risk factors for functional dyspepsia have been shown to include females and underlying psychological disturbances, whilst environmental/lifestyle habits such as poor socio-economic status, smoking, increased caffeine intake and ingestion of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs appear to be more relevant to uninvestigated dyspepsia.</p>
                        <h2>2.   GERD:</h2>
                        <h2>Gastro-Esophageal  Reflux  Disease  (GERD)</h2>
                        <p>GERD is defined as chronic symptom or mucosal damage produced by the abnormal reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus. Reflux esophagitis refers to a subgroup of GERD patients with histopathologically demonstrated characteristic changes in the esophageal mucosa.</p>
                        <img class="tree-structure2" src="<?php echo base_url().'tutorial/ad/'; ?>assets/images/tree-structure9.jpg" alt="tree-structure9">
                        <h2>Nonerosive reflux  disease</h2>
                        <p>Also knows as endoscopy-negative reflux disease, refers to patients with typical GERD symptoms caused by intraesophageal acid that do not have visible mucosal injury at endoscopy. On the other hand, functional heartburn is defined as episodic retrosternal burning without evidence of increased esophageal acid exposure or other structural esophageal etiology.</p>
                        <h2>Treatment:</h2>
                        <p>The  various  agents  currently  used  for  treatment  of  GERD  include  Mucoprotective substances, Antacids,  H2 Blockers,  Prokinetics  PPIs. </p>
                        <h2>3.   LARYNGOPHARYNGEAL REFLUX (LPR) :</h2>
                        <p>Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) is the backflow of stomach contents up the esophagus and into  the  throat.</p>
                        <p>There are two sphincter muscles located in the esophagus: The lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and the upper esophageal sphincter (UES). When the lower esophageal sphincter is not functioning properly, there is a back flow of stomach acid into the esophagus. This condition is called as GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease)</p>
                        <p>As with the lower esophageal sphincter, if the upper esophageal sphincter doesn’t function properly, acid that has back flowed into the esophagus is allowed into the throat and larynx. When this happens, it’s called Laryngopharyngeal Reflux (LPR)</p>
                        <p>LPR is different than gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) as Patients with GERD are usually suffer from heartburn and esophagitis while the patients with LPR do suffer from heartburn  or  esophagitis  (12%)</p>

                        <h2 class="underline">GASTROPARESIS </h2>
                        <p>Gastroparesis means paralysis of the muscles of the stomach which results in delayed emptying  of  the  food  from  the  stomach  to  the  small  intestine.</p>
                        <p>Gastroparesis is more common in diabetic patients because of the damage of the nerves which generally control the stomach muscles. So it is also called as Diabetic Gastroparesis.</p>
                        <p>Ordinarily, strong muscular contractions propel food on its long and convoluted journey through the digestive tract. But in gastroparesis, the muscles in the wall of the stomach work poorly or not at all, preventing the stomach from emptying properly. This can interfere with digestion, cause nausea and vomiting, and play havoc with blood sugar levels and nutrition.</p>
                        <h2>Treatment:</h2>
                        <p>Controlling diabetes or any other underlying condition that may be causing gastroparesis is the first step in treating the condition. Beyond this, dietary changes and medications that increase stomach contractions have long been the mainstay of gastroparesis therapy.</p>
                        <p>Doctors usually prescribe two types of drugs to treat gastroparesis – anti-emetics which help control nausea and vomiting and prokinetics, which stimulate contractions of the stomach  muscles.</p>

                        <h2 class="underline">IRRITABLE  BOWEL  SYNDROME  (IBS)  WITH  CONSTIPATION:</h2>
                        <p>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic gastrointestinal disorder of unknown cause. Common symptoms include abdominal cramping or pain, bloating and gassiness and altered bowel habits. Irritable bowel syndrome has also been called spastic colon, functional bowel disease and mucous colitis.</p>
                        <p>Irritable bowel syndrome is not contagious, inherited, or cancerous. It is estimated that 20% of  population  have  symptoms  of  IBS.  It  occurs  more  often  in  women  than  in men and  the  onset  occurs  before  the  age  of  35  in  about  half  of  the  cases. </p>
                        <p>Chronic constipation caused by motility disturbances of the lower digestive tract, for many begin in childhood and persists into adulthood. Constipation for those with digestive motility problems is much more than a mere nuisance. Constipation of this nature may be so  disabling  to  the  sufferer  as  to  vastly  restrict  social  functions  and  activities.</p>
                        <h2>TREATMENT OF GI MOTILITY DISORDERS</h2>
                        <p>The motility disorders are also associated with increased levels of acid seretion. Thus there is need of combination therapy of a PPI + Prokinetic which will not only correct the motility but also control excessive acid secretion.</p>
                        <h2>Prokinetic  agents:</h2>

                        <p>Levosulpiride is a levorotatory enantiomer of sulpiride, a substituted benzamide, chemically it is (S)-(-) Sulpiride; (S)-5-Aminosulfonyl-N-[(1-ethyl-2- pyrrolidinyl)methyl]-2-methoxybenzamide. Levosulpiride is reported to be a selective antagonist of dopamine D2 receptors having activity on both central and peripheral levels. It is a prokinetic & used in the treatment of dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome.</p>
                        <img class="tree-structure2" src="<?php echo base_url().'tutorial/ad/'; ?>assets/images/tree-structure10.jpg" alt="tree-structure10">
                        <p>It is a prokinetic agent which increases the lower esophageal sphincter pressure more rapidly and effectively than other therapeutic agents.</p>
                        <h2 class="underline">MECHANISM OF ACTION:</h2>
                        <h2>As a Prokinetic:</h2>
                        <p>The prokinetic effect of Levosulpiride is mediated through the blockade of enteric (neuronal and muscular) inhibitory dopamine D2 receptors. It also acts as a moderate agonist at the 5-HT4 receptor. The serotonergic (5-HT4) component of Levosulpiride enhances its therapeutic efficacy in gastrointestinal disorders. This property together with antagonism at D2  receptors,  may  contribute  to  its  gastrointestinal  prokinetic  effect.</p>
                        <h2>As an Antiemetic:</h2>
                        <p>The antiemetic effect of Levosulpiride is due to inhibition of dopamine transmission and antagonism with D2 receptors of the neurons in the area postrema of the vomiting center (IV ventricle) or chemoreceptor trigger zone in the CNS, blocking the inhibitory effect of dopamine on cholinergic neurons and therefore permitting a sustained cholinergic induced contraction of smooth muscle cell in the myenteric plexus of the esophagus, stomach  and  intestine.</p>

                        <p>More dysfunctions at the gastric or duodenal level can result in gastric stasis. Symptoms typically associated with delayed gastric emptying include nausea, vomiting, early or easy satiety, bloating, and weight loss. Reflux is characterized by impaired esophageal acid clearance, impotence of anti-reflux barrier and delayed gastric emptying. Prokinetic drugs have been used in addition to proton pump inhibitors for suppression of significant symptoms.</p>
                        <p>Thus Pantoprazole reduces acid secretion and Levosulpiride corrects dysmotility.</p>
                        <p>Besides this combination also provides OD dosage convenience and thus enhances patient compliance.</p>
