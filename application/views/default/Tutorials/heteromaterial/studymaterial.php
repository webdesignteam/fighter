                <h4><strong>Introduction</strong></h4>
                <ul class="text-justify">
                    <li>Influenza (flu) is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that infect the nose, throat, and sometimes the lungs. It can cause mild to severe illness.</li>
                    <li>Seasonal flu infection peaks between June and October and registering an additional minor peak from December to February, as per WHO. This means a total of 8 months every year.</li>
                    <li>It has a sudden onset, and causes respiratory tract infection with fever and generally limits itself. </li>
                    <li>Complications of flu can include bacterial pneumonia, ear infections, sinus infections, and worsening of chronic medical conditions, such as congestive heart failure, asthma, or diabetes.
                        <li>It may also lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome, meningitis, encephalitis and similar life-threatening severe clinical conditions.</li>
                        <li>Anyone can get the flu (even healthy people), and serious problems related to the flu can happen at any age, but some people are at high risk of developing serious flu-related complications if they get sick. This includes people 65 years and older, people of any age with certain chronic medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, or heart disease), pregnant women, and young children. </li>
                        <li>Seasonal flu is the term used to refer to the flu outbreaks that occur yearly, mainly in the winter. </li>
                        <li>Pandemic flu refers to particularly virulent strains of flu that spread rapidly from person to person to create a world-wide epidemic (pandemic). </li>
                        <li>The best way to prevent the flu is by getting vaccinated each year.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4><strong>Swine (H1N1) Flu</strong></h4>
                <ul class="text-justify">
                    <li>Swine Influenza (swine flu) is a respiratory disease of pigs caused by type A influenza virus that regularly causes outbreaks of influenza in pigs.</li>
                    <li>Swine flu viruses do not usually infect humans, but rare human infections have occurred.</li>
                    <li>Swine flu viruses can cause high levels of illness in pig, but cause few deaths in pigs.</li>
                    <li>Swine influenza viruses can circulate among swine throughout the year, but most outbreaks occur during the late fall and winter months similar to outbreaks in humans.</li>
                    <li>Like influenza viruses in humans and other animals, swine flu viruses change constantly. </li>
                    <li>Pigs can be infected by avian influenza and human influenza viruses as well as swine influenza viruses. When influenza viruses from different species infect pigs, the viruses can reassert (i.e. swap genes) and new viruses that are a mix of swine, human and/or avian influenza viruses can emerge.</li>
                    <li>At this time, there are three main influenza A virus subtypes that have been isolated in pigs in the United States: H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2.</li>
                    <li>When an influenza virus that normally circulates in swine (but not people) is detected in a person, it is called a “variant influenza virus.” For example, if a swine origin influenza A H3N2 virus is detected in a person, that virus will be called an “H3N2 variant” virus or “H3N2” virus.</li>
                    <li>Most commonly, human infections with variant viruses have occurred in people exposed to infected pigs (e.g., children near pigs at a fair or workers in the swine industry). Also, person-to-person spreads of variant viruses have occurred.</li>

                </ul>
                <h4><strong>Structure of Influenza Virus</strong></h4>
                <ul class="text-justify">
                    <li>The influenza virion (as the infectious particle is called) is roughly spherical. Influenza viruses are enveloped viruses with single-stranded RNA belonging to the Orthomyxoviridae family.</li>
                    <li>The virus has 8 segments of RNA and it codes for different proteins such as nucleoprotein (NP), haemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), proteins of polymerase complex (PB1 PB2 and PA), matrix proteins (M1 and M2) and non-structural proteins (NS1 and NS2), mitochondrial protein PB1-F2, and other proteins such as PB1-N40, PA-X, NS3, M42, PA-N155 and PA-N182.</li>
                    <li>All of the segments of vRNA are associated with polymerase complex and nucleoprotein (NP), and they form ribonucleoproteins (RNP), which are responsible for transcription and replication of influenza.</li>
                    <img src="<?php echo base_url().'tutorial/heteromaterial/' ?>structureinfluenza.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block">
                    <li>Haemagglutinin (HA) is trans-membrane glycoprotein which is responsible for initiation of infection, and interaction with sialic acid receptor of host cell. Interaction of HA with sialic acid receptor leads to virus entry into the host cell, release of viral RNA and viral replication.</li>
                    <li>Neuraminidase (NA) represents second surface antigen of influenza, and it is involved in releasing of newly formed virions out of host cell. Neuraminidase has to cleave sialic acid from the surface of host cells enzymatically, before releasing of new virions.</li>
                    <li>Influenza viruses are classified in four different types including influenza A, influenza B, influenza C and influenza D according to major antigenic properties.<b>The types which most commonly cause to morbidity in humans are influenza A and B which are responsible for seasonal flu epidemics each year.</b></li>
                    <li>Influenza A is divided into different subtypes depending on the genes that make up the surface proteins such as hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. At least 16 different hemagglutinins and 9 different neuraminidases are found in influenza A. A single hemagglutinin and a single neuraminidase are present in influenza B. Currently circulating in humans are subtype A (H1N1) and A(H3N2) influenza viruses. Exceptionally avian HA subtypes can cause disease in humans: H5, H7 and H9. Only influenza type A viruses are known to have caused pandemics.</li>
                    <li><b>Influenza B</b> viruses are not classified into subtypes, but can be broken down into lineages. Currently circulating influenza type B viruses belong to either B/Yamagata or B/Victoria lineage.</li>
                    <li>All types of hemagglutinins and neuraminidases are found in poultry, whereas hemaglutinin type 1, 2, 3 and 5, 7 and 9 (in recent years), neuraminidase type 1 and 2 has been found in humans in seasonal influenza, epidemics and pandemics.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4><strong>Replication Cycle of Influenza Virus</strong></h4>
                <ul class="text-justify">
                    <li>Haemaglutinin and neuraminidase are the transmembrane spike glycoproteins which protrude from the surface of the influenza A and B viruses</li>
                    <li>The receptor for haemaglutinin is sialic acid that is present on the surface of many cells, including the ciliated columnar epithelial cells of the respiratory tract and glycoproteins in the mucus that covers the epithelium of the respiratory tract.</li>
                    <li>Binding of haemagglutinin to the sialic acid on the host cell allows the virus to penetrate the plasma cell membrane, uncoat and enter into the cytoplasm, where its RNA strands replicate in order to produce new viruses.</li>
                    <li>Neuraminidase cleaves the haemaglutinin-sialic acid bonds and releases newly formed viral particles from the surface of infected cells and it increases the mobility of the virus through the mucus of the respiratory tract</li>

                </ul>
                <h4><strong>Transmission of Flu Virus</strong></h4>
                <ul class="text-justify">
                    <li>People with flu can spread it to others up to about 6 feet away.</li>
                    <li>Flu viruses are spread mainly by droplets made when people with flu cough, sneeze or talk.</li>
                    <li>These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.</li>
                    <li>To avoid this, people should stay away from sick people and stay home if sick. It also is important to wash hands often with soap and water.</li>
                    <li>Most healthy adults may be able to infect other people beginning 1 day before symptoms develop and up to 5 to 7 days after becoming sick. Children may pass the virus for longer than 7 days. Symptoms start 1 to 4 days after the virus enters the body.</li>

                </ul>
                <h4><strong>Symptoms of Influenza</strong></h4>
                <p class="text-justify">People who have the flu often feel some or all of these signs and symptoms that usually start suddenly, not gradually:</p>
                <ul class="text-justify">
                    <li>Fever* or feeling feverish/chills</li>
                    <li>Cough</li>
                    <li>Sore throat</li>
                    <li>Runny or stuffy nose</li>
                    <li>Muscle or body aches</li>
                    <li>Headaches</li>
                    <li>Fatigue (very tired)</li>
                    <li>Some people may have vomiting and diarrhea, though this is more common in young children than in adults</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-justify">*It’s important to note that not everyone with flu will have a fever.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">The time from when a person is exposed to flu virus and infected to when symptoms begin is about 1 to 4 days, with an average of about 2 days.</p>
                <h4><strong>Treatment and Prevention of Influenza</strong></h4>
                <ul class="text-justify">
                    <li>Many people do not require treatment for influenza, and recover within one to two weeks; however, treatment may be of significant benefit to those at high risk of complications or those who for whatever reason need to minimize their absence from work.</li>
                    <li>Treatment should not be delayed until the results of diagnostic tests are available.</li>
                    <li>Treatment is largely supportive and consists of bed rest, increased fluid consumption, cough suppressants, and antipyretics and analgesics such as acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for fever.</li>
                    <li>The two key pharmaceutical interventions available for influenza are:</li>
                    <ul class="text-justify">
                        <li>Vaccination</li>
                        <li>Antiviral dugs</li>
                    </ul>
                    <span><strong>Vaccination:</strong></span>
                    <ul class="text-justify">
                        <li>The most effective method of preventing influenza infection is through vaccination.</li>
                        <li>In children, vaccination is recommended starting at 6 months of age.</li>
                        <li>Vaccination to prevent influenza is particularly important for persons who are at increased risk for severe complications from influenza as well as those people who live with or care for persons at higher risk for influenza-related complications. </li>
                        <li>The available vaccine takes about 2-3 weeks for development of immunity. The use of chemoprophylaxis during this period may be considered.</li>
                        <li>The vaccine requires regular upgradation because of antigenic variation.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <span><strong>Antiviral Drugs:</strong></span>
                    <ul class="text-justify">
                        <li>The mainstay of the treatment is antiviral drugs.</li>
                        <li><b>Antiviral drugs can make illness milder and shorten the time of illness. They may also prevent serious flu complications.</b></li>
                        <li>Anti-influenza drugs include the M2 channel blockers (amantadine and rimantadine) and the <b>neuraminidase enzyme inhibitors (zanamivir and oseltamivir).</b></li>
                        <li>These drugs interfere with several stages in the viral replication cycle: entry, viral assembly virus, or release.</li>
                        <li><b>Neuraminidase Inhibitors:</b> block the viral neuraminidase enzyme, which is critical in releasing virions from the infected host’s cells. These drugs are active against influenza A and B.</li>
                        <li><b>M2 channel blockers:</b>interfere with hydrogen ion channel activity of the influenza A virus, thus blocking its entry into the host cells. These are active only against influenza A viruses. The resistance to these drug is very high and hence currently they are not being used in managing influenza. </li>
                        <li>The CDC recommends initiating treatment as soon as possible after the onset of influenza-like symptoms in patients.</li>
                        <li>The CDC also recommends antiviral prophylaxis for persons who have had close contact with an infected person during the infectious period.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-justify">The Government of India guidelines for case management of influenza A/H1N1 require classification of influenza patients into three categories.</p>
                <h4><strong>Category A:</strong></h4>
                <li>It includes mild cases (fever plus cough/sore throat with or without body ache, headache, diarrhoea and vomiting) where no laboratory testing or antiviral treatment is needed.</li>
                <h4><strong>Category B:</strong></h4>
                <li>In addition to all the signs and symptoms mentioned under Category-A, if the patient has high-grade fever and severe sore throat, may require home isolation and oseltamivir.</li>
                <li>These patients need not be laboratory confirmed but should be isolated at their homes and given oseltamivir treatment. </li>
                <li>Broad spectrum antibiotics as per the guideline for community-acquired pneumonia may be prescribed.
                    <h4><strong>Category C:</strong></h4>
                    <li>In addition to the above signs and symptoms of Category A and B, if the patient has one or more of the following:</li>
                    <ul class="text-justify">
                        <li>Breathlessness, chest pain, drowsiness, fall in blood pressure, sputum mixed with blood, bluish discoloration of nails</li>
                        <li>Children with ILI who had a severe disease as manifested by the red flag signs (somnolence, high and persistent fever, inability to feed well, convulsions, shortness of breath, difficulty in breathing, etc.).</li>
                        <li>Worsening of underlying chronic conditions</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>These category C patients require laboratory testing, immediate hospitalization and oseltamivir treatment. </li>
                    <h4><strong>High Risk Group:</strong></h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">Patients who report with uncomplicated clinical presentation due to confirmed or strongly suspected virus infection and are in a group known to be at higher risk of developing severe or complicated illness, should be treated with oseltamivir as soon as possible.</p>
                    <ul class="text-justify">
                        <li>Children, with mild illness but with predisposing risk factors</li>
                        <li>Pregnant women</li>
                        <li>Persons aged 65 years or older</li>
                        <li>Patients with lung diseases, heart disease, liver disease, kidney disease, blood disorders, diabetes neurological disorders, cancer and HIV/AIDS</li>
                        <li>Patients on long term cortisone therapy</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4><strong>Chemoprophylaxis with Antiviral Drugs</strong></h4>
                    <ul class="text-justify">
                        <li>Prophylaxis must be continued throughout the epidemic and the treatment must begin within 24 hrs of onset of illness. </li>
                        <li>For chemoprophylaxis, an antiviral drug must be taken each day for the duration of potential exposure to a person with influenza and continued for 7 days after the last known exposure.</li>
                        <li>Post exposure chemoprophylaxis is typically administered for no more than 10 days after the most recent known exposure to a close contact known to have influenza.</li>

                    <h4><strong>What is Oseltamivir ?</strong></h4>
                    <ul class="text-justify">
                        <li>Oseltamivir is a prodrug of oseltamivir carboxylate, approved by US FDA in the year 1999 for the first time in treatment and prophylaxis of influenza.</li>
                        <li>Considering the increasing number of Flu cases and with a view to ensure availability of Oseltamivir at more chemists, the Government of India has brought Oseltamivir in Schedule H1 (previously under Schedule X).</li>
                        <li>It is a potent and a selective inhibitor of neuraminidase glycoprotein which is essential for replication of influenza A and B viruses.</li>
                        <li>It is effective against all strains of Influenza A and B (including the avian H5N1, swine origin H1N1 and H9N2 strains).</li>
                        <li>It has gained worldwide attention in view of Influenza A (H1N1) pandemic. It is one of the most important drugs effective against the novel influenza virus.</li>
                        <li>CDC recommends starting treatment without waiting for lab confirmation of influenza.</li>
                        <li>Oseltamivir is most effective when commenced within 48 hour of illness onset. </li>
                        <li>Early initiation of therapy ( within 2 days of illness onset ) ensure greater survival benefit.
                            <li>Oseltamivir was approved in more than 100 countries by February 2011.</li>
                            <li>It significantly reduces the duration of symptomatic illness and hastens the return to normal levels of activity when initiated promptly within 48 hours in patients with naturally acquired influenza.</li>
                            <li>The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends oseltamivir treatment for all patients in severe and progressive influenza and even recommends a higher dose and longer treatment depending on the clinical response for patients with immunosuppression.</li>
                            <li>Oseltamivir is the drug of choice recommended by the Indian government for the treatment and chemoprophylaxis of influenza.</li>
                            <li>Oseltamivir provides symptomatic relief for patients with influenza infection, reduce viral excretion from the nose, and interrupt the household viral transmission.</li>
                            <li>In addition, oseltamivir reduces the symptoms of flu, antibiotic uses, and complications such as bronchitis, pneumonia, otitis media and death.</li>
                            <li>Oseltamivir 75 mg twice daily for 5 days reduced illness duration by up to 1.5 days and illness severity by up to 38% in unvaccinated patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza.
                                <li>It hastens the return to normal levels of activity when initiated promptly within 48 hours in patients with naturally acquired influenza.</li>
                                <li>The oseltamivir treatment may reduce nearly 60% of the secondary spread of influenza.
                                    <li>Prophylaxis with oral oseltamivir 75 mg once or twice daily for 6 weeks during an influenza outbreak may prevent the development of naturally acquired influenza in as many as 76% of healthy unvaccinated adults.</li>
                                    <li>Oseltamivir is generally well tolerated with nausea (10%) and vomiting (&lt;10%) being the most commonly reported adverse events.</li>
                                    <li>Zanamivir is administrated via oral inhalation and has been reported to cause bronchospasm or respiratory decline in some patients. For this reason, it is not generally recommended in patients with underlying airways disease. Oseltamivir has not been associated with adverse respiratory events.</li>
                                    <li>Oseltamivir is preferred for use in pregnant women if benefit justifies the potential risk and in patients with underlying airway disease.</li>
                                    <li>Resistance to oseltamivir is seen uncommonly after clinical use.</li>
                                    <li>Oseltamivir therefore represents a useful therapeutic option to zanamivir (especially in patients who prefer oral administration or who have an underlying respiratory disorder) and the M2 inhibitors amantadine and rimantadine (because of its broader spectrum of anti-influenza activity and lower likelihood of resistance) in patients who contract influenza</li>

                    <h4><strong>Mechanism of Action of Oseltamivir</strong></h4>
                    <ul class="text-justify">
                        <li>Oseltamivir is an ethyl ester prodrug of oseltamivir carboxylate.</li>
                        <li>Oseltamivir readily enters hepatocytes after its absorption, and is extensively converted into the active metabolite, oseltamivir carboxylate by hepatic carboxylesterases.</li>
                        <li>It selectively inhibits influenza A and B viral neuraminidase</li>
                        <li>Oseltamivir carboxylate prevents neuraminidase enzyme from cleaving sialic acid residues on the surfaces of the host cell.</li>
                        <li>Thus it prevents the release and spread of progeny virions from infected cell.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4><strong>Phramacokinetics</strong></h4>
                    <span><strong>Absorption:</strong></span>
                    <ul class="text-justify">
                        <li>Oseltamivir is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration and 75-80% reaches systemic circulation as the active drug (oseltamivir carboxylate).</li>
                        <li>Cmax is reached ≈3 to 4 hours after administration of oseltamivir.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <span><strong>Distribution:</strong></span>

                    <ul class="text-justify">
                        <li>Oseltamivir carboxylate is eliminated by a first-order process, primarily by glomerular filtration and renal tubular secretion.</li>

                        <li>63% of the 100 mg dose is recovered as active drug in urine and less than 20% in faeces as either unchanged drug or oseltamivir carboxylate.</li>

                    <p class="text-justify">India has recorded an alarming spike in swine flu (H1N1) this year, with more than 12000 cases and 377 deaths confirmed till February and the numbers continue to rise everyday. </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">The symptoms of swine flu are same like seasonal flu. Deaths have mostly occurred in cases with some underlying medical condition or in those with low immunity.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">Increase awareness about early initiation of therapy is the only way to prevent hospitalization and complications. Oseltamivir is the only anti-viral drug which is approved for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza amongst all age groups</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">It is a matter of pride that Fluvir is the only brand to have licensing rights from Hoffman – La – Roche.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">Considering the increasing number of Flu cases and the recent change in Schedule of Oseltamivir, our objective is to ensure round the year sales of Fluvir.</p>

                    <h4><b>ALLERGY</b></h4>
                    <h5><b>Overview</b></h5>
                    <p class="text-justify">Allergy occurs when a person's immune system reacts to substances in the environment that are harmless for most people. An allergy occurs when the body's immune system sees a substance as harmful and overreacts to it. The substances that cause allergic reactions are allergens and are found in dust mites, pets, pollen, insects, ticks, moulds, foods and some medicines. A substance that is an allergen for one person may not be for another.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">The likelihood (or risk) of developing allergies is increased if other family members suffer from allergy or asthma. Anaphylaxis is a serious allergic reaction that can be life-threatening.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">Allergies are one of the most common chronic diseases. A chronic disease lasts a long time or occurs often. When someone has allergies, their immune system makes an antibody called immunoglobulin E (IgE). These antibodies respond to allergens. The symptoms that result are an allergic reaction.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">The most common allergens are mentioned below:</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">Medications, Dust, Food, Insects that sting (bee, wasp, fire ant); bite (mosquito, tick); or are household pest (cockroach and dust mite), Latex, Mold, Pet (dog or cat urine, saliva and dander), Pollen.</p>
                    <h4><b>Symptoms of Allergy</b></h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">An allergic reaction causes inflammation and irritation. The signs and symptoms depend on the type of allergen. An allergic reaction typically triggers symptoms in the nose, lungs, throat, sinuses, ears, lining of the stomach or on the skin. For some people, allergies can also trigger symptoms of asthma. In the most serious cases, a life-threatening reaction called anaphylaxis can occur.</p>

                                <li>Basically people who are prone to allergies are atopic, that means they have a hereditary tendency to produce excess amount of immunoglobulins E (IgE) in response to the allergens such as dust, pollen etc.</li>
                                <li>In an allergic individual, entry of the allergen into airway for the first time stimulates the release of a large number of antibodies known as IgE. Some antibodies are used to destroy the allergen, the excess amount bind to receptor sites on the mast cells. The mast cells in response are programmed to produce but not release a number of inflammatory mediators such as histamine. The mast cell is sensitised.

                                <li>Phospholipids in presence of enzyme phospholipase A2 get converted to arachidonic acid.</li>
                                <li>This is acted upon by two enzymes: Lipoxygenase and Cyclooxygenase (COX)</li>

                                        <li><b>This process of release of chemicals by mast cell is known as mast cell degranulation.</b> Histamine binds to histamine receptors (H1). The immediate response of the airway to chemicals such as histamine is bronchospasm. It is able to produce dilation of blood vessels (vasodilation), increased permeability of blood vessels (fluid leak) and nerve stimulation. This leads to the development of redness (erythema), swelling (edema) and itching (pruritus). Histamine also stimulates the mucous membranes to secrete excess mucous, further narrowing the bronchial lumen.</li>
                                        <li>This phase is known as the early allergic response (EAR) and generally occurs 5-30 minutes after exposure to the allergen.</li>

                                        <li>Eosinophils are the most important cells in airway hyper-reactivity. Eosinophils release certain powerful cytotoxic substances such as MBP (Major Basic Protein) and ECP (Eosinophilic Cationic Protein).</li>
                                        <li>ECP acts on epithelial cells leading to epithelial shedding and further tissue damage and inflammation. Epithelial cells along with excessive mucus production form mucus plugs which further block the lumen of the airways.</li>
                                        <li>This phase is known as the late allergic response (LAR). This phase occurs 3 to 11 hours after exposure to the allergen.</li>

                    <ul class="text-justify">
                        <li>The first-line treatment of allergic rhinitis involves the avoidance of relevant allergens (e.g., house dust mites, moulds, pets, pollens) and irritants (e.g., tobacco smoke).</li>
                        <li>Reduction of outdoor exposure during the season in which a particular type of pollen is present can be helpful.</li>
                        <li>As with indoor allergens, avoidance is the best measure. When this is not possible, a mask or respirator might be needed.</li>
                        <li>Environmental control measures fundamental to eliminate or reduce the exposure to allergens in managing allergic disorders.</li>

                    <h4><strong>ASTHMA AND ALLERGY</strong></h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways characterized by airflow obstruction and airway hyperreponsiveness to multiple stimuli. This widespread but variable airflow obstruction is caused by bronchospasm, edema of the airway mucosa, increased mucus production with plugging, and airway remodeling.</p>
                    <h5><strong>Pathophysiology</strong></h5>
                    <p class="text-justify">It's widely believed that atopy - the genetic predisposition for the development of an immunoglobulin E-mediated response to common allergens - is the strongest identifiable factor for developing asthma. Asthma is classified as extrinsic or intrinsic, based on what triggers it.</p>
                    <ul class="text-justify">
                        <li>Asthma is called extrinsic, or atopic, when chronic inflammation creates a state of bronchial hyperreponsiveness that caused airways to over respond upon future exposure to various stimuli. Patients with extrinsic asthma demonstrate increased levels of serum IgE as well as positive skin-test results and a family history of asthma or allergies, indicating atopic origin. This form of asthma is more common in children and young adults.</li>
                        <li>Asthma is called intrinsic, when patients demonstrate increased airway hyperresponsivenss triggers by irritants such as ozone, exercise, cold air, and viral infection. Skin testing for allergy is negative, no atopic family history exists, and serum IgE level is normal. Patients with these findings are classified as having intrinsic, nonallergic.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="text-justify">Many other patients have a combination of findings and don't clearly fall into either category.</p>
                    <h4><strong>Link between Allergic Rhinitis & Asthma</strong></h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">Allergic rhinitis and asthma are both chronic heterogeneous disorders, with an overlapping epidemiology of prevalence, health care costs and social costs in quality of life. Around 40% of AR patients had asthma, and 30% to 80% of asthmatic patients reported AR. The presence of allergic rhinitis and positive results of allergen skin tests were shown to be important risk factors of asthma development. Patients with allergic rhinitis have a threefold greater chance of developing asthma.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">To better understand the possible links between asthma and allergic rhinitis, the World Health Organization, through the Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) program, examined the impact of allergic rhinitis on asthma. The ARIA study concluded that allergic rhinitis is a major chronic respiratory disease due to its prevalence, impact on quality of life, impact on school and work performance and productivity, economic burden, and links to asthma.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">Combined therapy with montelukast and an antihistamine for asthmatic patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis lessens the need for a rescue inhaler and improves lung function and asthma symptom score. So the combination therapy with a new generation antihistamine and antileukotrienes will have better outcomes in preventing the expression of the asthma in individuals who have rhinitis and to achieve better control of asthma in patients who already have both rhinitis and asthma.</p>
                    <h3 class="text-center"><strong>Classification of Antihistamines (H1 Receptor Antagonists)</strong></h3>
                    <p class="text-justify">Histamine, an important chemical mediator of allergic inflammation, is produced and stored in cytoplasmic granules in tissue mast cells and basophils, from which it is released in large quantities by noncytotoxic mechanisms during the early allergic response. It is an important chemical mediator of inflammation, vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, decreased peripheral resistance, airway smooth muscle contraction, and sensory nerve stimulation causing itching and other symptoms of allergy. It also plays a significant role in neurotransmission and in cardiac function. Since histamine is one of the major chemical mediator responsible for the signs and symptoms of allergic rhinitis, the drug which block the action of released histamines are called as antihistamines. They usually act on H1 receptors and are the preferred drugs in the treatment of allergy.</p>

                    <h4><strong>Introduction</strong></h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">Fexofenadine, the active metabolite of terfenadine, is a second-generation, highly selective, non-sedating, peripheral histamine H1-receptor antagonist. Fexofenadine has been demonstrated to inhibit allergen induced symptoms in subjects with seasonal allergic rhinitis as well as nasal congestion in subjects with perennial allergic rhinitis. It significantly improves quality of life and reduces the impairment of performance at work and during daily activities that is frequently associated with the symptoms of AR. It is a suitable option for first-line therapy in managing seasonal AR.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">Motelukast is a potent, specific, cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist used for the treatment of asthma. Montelukast reduces the signs and symptoms of chronic asthma in adults and children. Also, montelukast attenuates exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in such patients.
                    </p>
                    <h4><strong>Composition</strong></h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">Each film-coated tablet contains: </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">Fexofenadine…………. 120 mg</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">Montelukast ………….. 10 mg</p>
                    <h4><strong>Pharmacodynamics</strong></h4>
                    <h5><strong>Mechanism of Action</strong></h5>
                    <p class="text-justify">Fexofenadine is the active metabolite of terfenadine. It is an antihistamine having selective peripheral H1- receptor antagonist activity. Its blocks the unwanted effects of histamine in the body thereby reducing itching, sneezing, running nose etc. Both enantiomers of fexofenadine hydrochloride showed equivalent antihistaminic response. It has no anticholinergic or alpha1-adrenergic blocking effects so side effects such as dryness of mouth, constipation do not occur. Moreover, it does not cross blood brain barrier and so no sedative or other central nervous system effects were observed.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4) are potent inflammatory eicosanoids released from various cells including mast cells and eosinophils. These important pro- asthmatic mediators bind to cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLT) receptors. The CysLT type- 1 (CysLT1) receptor is found in the human airway (including airway smooth muscle cells and airway macrophages) and on other pro-inflammatory cells (including eosinophils and certain myeloid stem cells). CysLTs have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma and allergic rhinitis. In asthma, leukotriene-mediated effects include bronchoconstriction, mucous secretion, vascular permeability, and eosinophil recruitment. In allergic rhinitis, CysLTs are released from the nasal mucosa after allergen exposure during both early- and late-phase reactions and are associated with symptoms of allergic rhinitis. Montelukast is an orally active compound which binds with high affinity and selectivity to the CysLT1 receptor in the lungs and bronchial tubes. This reduces the bronchoconstriction otherwise caused by the leukotriene and results in less inflammation. The cysteinyl leukotrienes C4, D4, and E4 are potent mediators of contractions of airway smooth muscle. Montelukast acts by antagonizing these compounds at their receptor, thus protecting against bronchoconstriction. Bronchodilation was observed within 2 hours of oral administration.</p>

                    <p class="text-justify">Levocetirizine (R-cetirizine) is the active enantiomer of cetirizine. Some drugs come in two forms called enantiomers. The Enantiomers are mirror images of such other. They are termed as right handed or left handed based on their geometry. One of the enantiomer is responsible for activity, when both forms of enantiomers are present in a drug, the drug is said to be recemic mixture or racemate.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">The enantiomers of recemic drugs are described as R&S form or Levo and Dextro form. Enantiomers often exhibit different pharmacokinetic properties. Cetirizine is a racemic mixture of S- and R-enantiomers. R-enantiomer (Levocetirizine) offers specific binding towards H1 receptor, twice potency as compared to Cetirizine and less side effects (no sedation). The R-enantiomer, Levocetirizine has the antihistamine properties.Levocetrizine is manufactured by Chiral synthesis.</p>

                    <p class="text-justify">Levocetirizine is rapidly and extensively absorbed following oral administration. The bioavailability is about 85%. The peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of Levocetirizine is achieved in 0.5 to 1.5 hours (Faster concentrations leads to rapid onset of action). The mean peak plasma concentrations are 0.27 ± mcg/ml after a dose of 5 mg.</p>

                    <p class="text-justify">Levocetirizine is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment, hypersensitivity to Levocetirizine, piperazine derivatives or to any ingredient in the formulation. For Levocetirizine no data on exposed human pregnancy is available. Hence it should be used in pregnancy only when the benefits to the mother outweigh the risk to the fetus. Use of Levocetirizine in lactating women is not recommended as it is expected to be excreted in breast milk.</p>
                    <h4><strong>Precautions</strong></h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">Caution is recommended with the intake of alcohol. Although there is no evidence, at the recommended dose, that Levocetirizine impairs mental alertness, reactivity or the ability to drive, patients intending to drive should not exceed the recommended dose and should take their responses into account.</p>
                    <h4><strong>Adverse Effects</strong></h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">The incidence of adverse effects is mild to moderate. Levocetirizine has been shown not to impair mental alertness, reaction times or the ability to drive. The side effects include dry mouth, somnolence, fatigue. There is no data on effect of Levocentirizine on QT interval, but Cetirizine appears to be free of any cardiovascular side effects.</p>
                    <h4><strong>Drug Interactions</strong></h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">The extent of absorption of Levocetirizine is not reduce with food, although the rate of absorption is decreased. Co-administration with alcohol or other CNS depressants may have depressant effects on the CNS in sensitive patients.</p>

                    <h4><strong>Levocetirizine</strong></h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">Levocetirizine works by blocking histamine receptors. It does not prevent the actual release of histamine from mast cells, but prevents its binding to its receptors. This in turn prevents the release of other allergy chemicals and increased blood supply to the area and also provides relief from the typical symptoms of allergic rhinitis. (for Levocetirizine details please refer Levocet)</p>

                    <h4><strong>ANATOMY OF NOSE:</strong></h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">The nose is the air conditioner of the body, responsible for warming and saturating inspired air, removing bacteria and particulate debris, as well as conserving heat and moisture from expired air. Nasal breathing is important for optimal pulmonary function. It is also a prominent cosmetic feature of the face.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">The anterior (front) portion of the nose is cartilaginous, while posteriorly and superiorly it is bony. Posteriorly the nose opens in the nasopharynx.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">Nasal cavity has a floor, a roof and lateral walls. Mucosa (mucous membrane) covers the inner surface of the nose.</p>
                    <h4><strong>PARANASAL SINUSES:</strong></h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">The paranasal sinuses are air-filled pockets located within the bones of the face and around the nasal cavity. Each sinus is named for the bone in which it is located:</p>
                    <ul class="text-justify">
                        <li>Maxillary (one sinus located in each cheek)</li>
                        <li>Ethmoid (approximately 6-12 small sinuses per side, located between the eyes)</li>
                        <li>Frontal (one sinus per side, located in the forehead)</li>
                        <li>Sphenoid (one sinus per side, located behind the ethmoid sinuses, near the middle of the skull)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="text-justify">Each of these pockets has an opening that connects to the nose. This opening is called an <b>ostium.</b></p>
                    <p class="text-justify">The nose and sinuses are closely related. The nasal septum divides the nose into two nasal cavities. The sidewall of the nose (the lateral nasal wall) has three important structures, which are known as the superior, middle and inferior turbinates.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">Each turbinate is a rounded projection that extends the length of the nasal cavity. The space under each turbinate is called a meatus.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">The paranasal sinuses drain into these spaces called meatus.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">The paranasal sinuses are covered with a special lining (or epithelium). The lining secretes mucus, a sticky substance that keeps the nose and sinuses moist. The sinus epithelium is ciliated; that is, each cell on its surface has a cilium (hair like protection), which is a relatively long structure that has the capacity to push sinus mucus.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">This movement of mucus (which is known as mucociliary clearance) is very important for maintenance of normal functioning of the sinuses.</p>
                    <h4><strong>Congestion:</strong></h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">Congestion means excessive accumulation of fluid in the tissues. This causes edema (swelling) and redness. In nasal congestion there is edema / swelling and redness of the nasal mucosa. This results from the dilatation of the mucosal blood vessels due to some underlying disease and leads to reversible obstruction of the nasal passage.</p>
                    <h4><strong>UPPER RESPIRATORY CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH CONGESTION:</strong></h4>
                    <ul class="text-justify">
                        <li>Allergic Rhinitis</li>
                        <li>Common Cold</li>
                        <li>Sinusitis</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4><b>COMMON COLD:</b></h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">“common cold” is called so because it is a very common condition. Billions of people are affected by ‘cold’ every year.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">Usually it is viral infection of the upper respiratory tract.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">Common cold generally involves running nose, nasal congestion and sneezing. There may also be sore throat, cough, headache or other symptoms. Over 200 viruses can cause a cold.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">Once the person gets infected with cold virus, the symptoms usually begin in 2 or 3 days, though it may take a week. Typically, an irritated nose or scratchy throat is the first sign, followed within hours by sneezing and a watery nasal discharge.</p>
                    <h4><b>Treatment:</b></h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">There is no effective therapy for cure of common cold. Common cold has to be treated symptomatically. Usual treatment is antistamines or combinations of antihistamine and a decongestant. These drugs do not actually shorten the length of a cold, but help in relieving the symptoms.</p>
                    <h4><b>Sinusitis:</b></h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">A disorder of the sinuses surrounding the nose, where one or more of these sinuses are inflamed. Acute sinusitis typically lasts 2 to 8 weeks.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">There are 4 pairs of sinuses connected to the nasal cavity by small openings called (ostia).</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">Nasal sinuses are small mucous-lined pockets within the facial bones surrounding the nose. Normally, these sinuses make mucus that drains from the sinuses into the nose while air passes freely in and out.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">Sinusitis (inflammation of the sinuses) occurs when at least one of these three conditions is manifest:</p>
                    <ul class="text-justify">
                        <li>The small openings (ostia) from the sinuses to the nose are blocked;</li>
                        <li>Small hairs (cilia) in the sinuses that help move the normally produced mucous out are not working;</li>
                        <li>Too much mucous is produced, often simply a result of inflammation. Any combination of these may cause sinusitis.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="text-justify">The most frequent cause of sinusitis is upper respiratory tract infections</p>
                    <h4><b>Sinusitis can produce  a  number  of  symptoms:</b></h4>
                    <ul class="text-justify">
                        <li>Facial pain - may be specific to the involved sinuses</li>
                        <li>Headache</li>
                        <li>Nasal discharge - may be yellow or green and could have a foul odour</li>
                        <li>Nasal congestion - stuffy nose</li>
                        <li>Post nasal drip - may result in a sore throat and / or cough</li>
                        <li>Loss of smell</li>
                        <li>Fatigue</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="text-justify">Besides the specific treatment with anti-infective agents preparations with antihistamines and decongestant are given in sinusitis to relieve the congestion and facilitate the drainage of the accumulated mucus.</p>
                    <h4><b>ANTIHISTAMINES:</b></h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">Histamine as we know is one of the most important mediator responsible for the signs and symptoms of allergic conditions. The peripheral effects of Histamine are caused by 2 sets of receptors termed H<sub>1</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> . The effects mediated by H<sub>1</sub> receptors include dilatation, increased permeability of the capillaries. The effects mediated by H<sub>2</sub> include secretion of gastric acid.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">The term ‘antihistamines’ normally denotes histamine H<sub>1</sub>-antagonists. Eg. CPM, Cetirizine, Levocetirizine and Fexofenadine</p>
                    <h4><b>DECONGESTANTS:</b></h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">These are the agents that relieve congestion. Most of the decongestants act by producing vasoconstriction, by stimulating the sympathetic receptors (alpha type on the blood vessels).</p>
                    <h4><b>Decongestants:</b></h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">These can be administered orally as well as topically.</p>
                    <img src="<?php echo base_url().'tutorial/heteromaterial/' ?>decongestants.png" class="img-responsive center-block">
                    <p class="text-justify"><b>Pseudoephedrine</b> which was used earlier as a decongestant has been banned in several countries due to its serious side effects like:</p>
                    <ul class="text-justify">
                        <li>Fast, pounding or uneven heartbeat</li>
                        <li>Severe dizziness, anxiety, restless feeling, or nervousness</li>
                        <li>Easy bruising or bleeding, unusual weakness, fever, chills, body aches, flu symptoms</li>
                        <li>Increased blood pressure (severe headache, blurred vision, trouble concentrating, chest pain, numbness, seizure).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="text-justify"><b>Phenylephrine</b> showed no consistent effect on heart rate or blood pressure for doses of 25mg or less.</p>
                    <h4><b>RATIONALE FOR THE COMBINATION:</b></h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">The upper respiratory conditions described above are associated with inflammation and congestion. Antihistamines block the action of histamine (which is the main mediator in the pathogenesis of these conditions) and thus reduce the inflammation and congestion. However, if the inflammation and congestion is severe an additional decongestant may be required for faster relief.</p>

                    <h4><b>Levocetirizine</b></h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">Levocetirizine (R-Cetirizine) is the active enantiomer of Cetirizine. Some drugs come in two forms called enantiomers. The enantiomers are mirror images of each other. They are termed as right handed or left-handed based on their geometry. One of the enantiomer is responsible for activity, when both forms of enantiomers are present in a drug, the drug is said to be racemic mixture or racemate.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">The enantiomers of racemic drugs are described as R & S form or Levo and Dextro form. Enantiomers often exhibit different pharmacokinetic properties. Cetirizine is a racemic mixture of S- and R-enantiomers. The R-enantiomer, Levocetirizine has the antihistamine properties.</p>
                    <h4><b>PHENYLEPHRINE</b></h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">Phenylephrine is less likely to cause side effects such as central nervous system stimulation, insomnia, anxiety, irritability and restlessness. Phenylephrine is a sympathomimetic amine. It stimulates the alpha receptors of the sympathetic system. Stimulates alpha receptors brings about vasoconstriction.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">Causes release of noradrenaline from the storage sites. Noradrenaline is a potent stimulator of sympathetic system. Vasoconstriction of the mucosal blood vessels causes shrinkage of the swollen mucosal vessels. This helps in opening up of the passage. The reduced congestion also improves the drainage of the sinuses in the nasal passage, thus reducing the symptoms of sinusitis.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">Phenylephrine shows greater selectivity for the nasal mucosa and a lower affinity for central nervous system (CNS) adrenergic-receptors than other sympathomimetic amines. This may be responsible for relatively lesser CNS related adverse effects with phenylephrine.</p>

                        <li><b>Allergic rhinitis with congestion:</b>
                            <p class="text-justify">Patients with allergic rhinitis frequently present with symptoms of rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing, daytime somnolence and fatigue associated with decreased cognitive performance and impaired quality of life Allergic rhinitis with nasal congestion can lead to disturbed sleep at night which causes day time sleepiness or daytime somnolence. Treating daytime somnolence due to allergic rhinitis requires a reduction in obstruction caused by nasal congestion.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Eustachian Tube Dysfunction:</b>
                            <p class="text-justify">Blocked Eustachian tubes can cause pain, hearing difficulties, and a feeling of fullness in the ears. Such a phenomenon is referred to as eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD). Upper respiratory tract infection, sinus infection, or allergies causing a swelling in the lining of the tissues of Eustachian tube can cause ETD. Eustachian tube patency is crucial for success of ENT surgeries like Tympanoplasty and Myringotomy. Therefore, there is scope for prescription of Levocet D+ to prevent ETD post ENT surgeries.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Common cold:</b>
                            <p class="text-justify">The common cold is an acute, self- limiting viral infection of the upper respiratory tract involving the nose, sinuses, pharynx and larynx. Symptoms typically peak at 1–3 days and last 7–10 days, although they occasionally persist for three weeks. Symptoms include sore throat, rhinitis, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, cough and malaise. Fever is common in children but rare and mild in adults. Rhinovirus accounts for 24%–52% of clinical cases or 52%–76% of infections with an identified pathogen. There the combination of Levocetirizine along with Phenylephrine will provide relief from all symptoms including nasal congestion. Also, as Levocetirizine inhibits HRV replication, patient will get faster relief.</li>
