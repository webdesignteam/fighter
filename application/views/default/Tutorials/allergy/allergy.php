                        <h2>ALLERGY AN OVERVIEW</h2>
                        <p>An allergy is sensitivity to a substance which does not normally cause people any discomfort or harm. Allergy means 'changed activity' and describes changes that occur after coming in contact with a foreign substance. Thus, when the body overreacts to otherwise harmless substances, it is called as allergy.</p>
                        <p class="italic-style">'Allergy - is defined as when an antigen, which is not harmful in itself, causes an immune response and reaction which gives rise to symptoms and disease in  a  few  predisposed  individuals  only'</p>
                        <h2>MECHANISM OF ALLERGIC REACTIONS</h2>
                        <ul class="fist-menu">
                            <li>Although, the term 'allergy' by definition originally covered all types of hypersensitivity reactions as well as the induction of immunity in an individual, nowadays, the term is more  commonly  applied  to  IgE  -  mediated  allergic  reactions.</li>
                            <li>The  term  "atopy"  is  often  used  to  describe  IgE-mediated  diseases.</li>
                            <li>Persons with atopy have a hereditary predisposition to produce IgE antibodies against common  environmental  allergens.</li>
                            <li>All of inhale environmental aeroallergens like pollens, house-dust, mites, etc.</li>
                            <li>After inhalation, antibodies are produced with the help of T helper cells.</li>
                            <li>The T helper  cells are  of  two  types:  Type  1  (Th1)  and Type  2  (Th2).</li>
                            <li>The types of antibodies produced depend on whether the person is allergic to that particular substance.</li>
                            <li>If a person is allergic, then Ig E antibodies are produced - otherwise Ig G antibodies are produced.</li>
                            <li class="images-link"><img src="<?php echo base_url().'tutorial/allergy/'; ?>assets/images/tree-structure.jpg" alt="tree-structure"></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>After IgE antibodies specific for certain allergen are synthesized and secreted, they bind to  mast  cells  and basophils.</p>
                        <ul class="fist-menu">
                            <li>When allergen is inhaled into the nose, the allergen cross-links these allergen- specific cell-bound IgE antibodies on the mast cell surface, whereupon rapid degranulation and mediator release occur (mediators are chemicals responsible to produce  signs  and  symptoms  of  allergy)</li>
                            <li>The most important mediator is histamine, which reproduces all of the symptoms of acute allergic rhinitis. Histamine causes vasodilation - that leads to nasal congestion, mucus secretion, and increased vascular permeability, which in turn leads to tissue edema  and  sneezing  through  stimulation  of  sensory  nerve  fibers.</li>
                            <li>The cross-linking of IgE antibody on mast cells also initiates the release of arachidonic acid from cell membrane. Mast cells then metabolize arachidonic acid - either via the cyclo-oxygenase pathway to form prostaglandins and thromboxane mediators or via the lipoxygenase pathway to form leukotrienes. Prostaglandin D2, the Leukotrienes  LTC4,  LTD4,  LTE4,  and  platelet  activating  factors  are  formed.</li>
                            <li>Once allergic reactions begin, mast cells amplify them by releasing not only agents mentioned earlier but also cytokines (another type of mediators). These cytokines further  promote  IgE  production,  and  eosinophil  chemotaxis.  When  eosinophil movement is promoted, eosinophils secret mediators, which favor TH cell proliferation. Eosinophils also release oxygen radicals and mediators, including eosinophil major basic protein, which are toxic to the nasal epithelium and which damages the nasal epithelium.</li>
                            <li>The mediators released during the pathogenesis are responsible for the clinical signs and symptoms. The signs and symptoms of allergic diseases occur in two phases - Early phase and Late phase.</li>
                            <li>The early response-starts within minutes, with degranulation of mast cells and is caused  by  histamines.</li>
                            <li>The  late  response-develops  after  4-6  hrs.  During  the  late  response  there  isaccumulation and activation of TH cells, eosinophils, and other cells, which all by  their  release  of  cytokines  mediators  and  cytotoxic  proteins  contribute  to  an inflammatory  reaction.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>CHEMICAL MEDIATORS IN ALLERGY MAST CELLS</h2>
                        <p>These cells are the primary initiating cells of IgE-mediated allergic reactions, as they have high-affinity receptors for IgE and synthesize, and release histamine and other chemical mediators. They are very important for eliciting symptoms in allergic rhinitis and urticaria.</p>

                            <li>The mast  cell  is  a  tissue  cell,  predominant  in  skin,  airway  and gastro-intestinal tract.</li>
                            <li>It  is  characterized  by  granules,  which  contain  histamine,  leukotrienes  and prostaglandins.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Chemical mediators, released from mast cells and basophils, are either stored in the granules  (histamine)  or  newly  synthesized  from  lipids  in  the  cells  membrane.</p>

                            <li>In the skin, it induces the typical wheal-and-flare reaction.</li>
                            <li>In the nose, it causes itching, hypersecretion and blockage.</li>
                            <li>Bronchial histamine inhalation results in broncho-constriction.</li>
                            <li>High plasma levels can result in anaphylaxis*. All these effects are mediated through H1 histamine  receptors.</li>

                        <h2 class="underline">What happens in Allergic Rhinitis</h2>
                        <p>The nose is a highly sensitive organ. Nasal mucosa, mucus-secreting membranes that line the nasal cavity, react to various environmental factors, which may include allergens (such as pollen and mold) and irritants (such as cigarette smoke and formaldehyde). When the mucosa encounters substances that interfere with proper functioning, the turbinates swell and mucus production increases in an effort to carry away offending irritants. The result is sneezing, nasal stuffiness, itching, a runny nose, and other signs and  symptoms.</p>
                        <h2 class="underline">Characteristics of Allergic Rhinitis</h2>
                        <ul class="fist-menu">
                            <li>Allergic rhinitis generally presents in atopic individuals, i.e., in persons with a family history of a similar or related symptom complex and a personal history of collateral allergy  expressed  as  eczematous  dermatitis,  urticaria,  and/or  asthma.</li>
                            <li>Allergic rhinitis is also associated with other allergic conditions like allergic conjunctivitis, atopic  dermatitis,  and  allergic  asthma.</li>
                            <li>Symptoms generally appear before the fourth decade of life and tend to diminish gradually with aging, although complete spontaneous remissions are uncommon.</li>
                            <li>The nasal mucosa swells, becomes red. Sometimes the conjunctiva becomes red. The pharynx may also appear congested.</li>
                            <li>Episodic rhinorrhea (watering of the nose), sneezing, and obstruction of the nasal passages with lachrymation and pruritus (itching) of the conjunctiva, nasal mucosa, and oropharynx  (itching  in  the  throat)  are  the  hallmarks  of  allergic  rhinitis.</li>
                            <li>Chronic allergic rhinitis may be associated with sinusitis, secretory otitis    media.</li>

                        <h2 class="underline">Treatment</h2>
                        <p>Management of allergic rhinitis includes avoidance of causative allergens. It may not be practical or possible every time. Hence symptomatic treatment is the mainstay in the management of allergic rhinitis. In the management of allergic conditions many types of  drugs  are  used. They  are:</p>
                        <ul class="fist-menu">
                            <li><b>Corticosteroids:</b> These drugs inhibit the enzyme phospholipase and ultimately prevent the release of mediators. They are highly effective in the management of all allergic conditions including allergic rhinitis. However if they are used indiscriminately they can cause serious side effects. If used for longer periods they have to be tapered off and  not  abruptly  stopped. They  can  even  be  used  topically.</li>
                            <li><b>Antihistamines:</b> There are many antihistamines available. Levocetirizine is distinctly superior  to  all  of  them  as  can  be  seen  from  subsequent  discussion.</li>
                            <li><b>Combinations of antihistamines and decongestants:</b> (like pseudoephedrine or phenylpropanolamine or phenylephrine): are also used in the management of allergic rhinitis. The nasal decongestants are mainly used to relieve the nasal congestion associated with common cold or allergic rhinitis. These decongestants can give rebound congestion as a side effect. Importantly Pseudoephedrine can sometimes cause tachycardia, restlessness etc. Levocetirizine provides benefits from all signs and symptoms of allergic rhinitis and would also be used in other allergic conditions.</li>
                            <li><b>Topical nasal drops:</b> These are combinations of antihistamines / decongestants. Besides inconvenience of use, these preparations are associated with side effects of rebound congestion, local irritation etc. The corticosteroids could also be used as nasal sprays. They may have to be used two times a day. However prolonged and indiscriminate use can cause serious side effects. Levocetirizine is an oral preparation and provides excellent relief from signs and symptoms of allergic rhinitis.</li>
                            <li><b>Mast cell stabilizers:</b> These drugs stabilize the mast cells and prevent the release of mediators secondary to allergen exposure. The effects are not apparent immediately. Moreover they have to be taken for a longer period of time. Ketotifen is given orally but sodium cromoglycate is given by intranasal route.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2>ASTHMA AND ALLERGY</h2>
                        <p>Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways characterized by airflow obstruction and airway hyperreponsiveness to multiple stimuli. This widespread but variable airflow obstruction is caused by bronchospasm, edema of the airway mucosa, increased mucus production with plugging, and airway remodeling.</p>
                        <h2 class="underline">Asthma</h2>
                        <p>Asthma is a predisposition to chronic inflammation of the lungs in which the airways (bronchi) are reversibly narrowed. Asthma is an airway disease that can be classified physiologically as a variable and partially reversible obstruction to air flow and pathologically with overdeveloped mucus glands, airway thickening due to scarring and inflammation, and bronchoconstriction, the narrowing of the airways in the lungs due to the tightening of surrounding smooth muscle. Bronchial inflammation also causes narrowing due to edema and swelling caused by an immune response to allergens.</p>
                        <p>Asthma affects 7% of the population worldwide. During asthma attacks (exacerbations of asthma), the smooth muscle cells in the bronchi constrict, and the airways become inflamed  and  swollen.  Breathing  becomes  difficult.</p>
                        <img class="tree-structure2" src="<?php echo base_url().'tutorial/allergy/'; ?>assets/images/tree-structure6.jpg" alt="tree-structure6">
                        <p>Inflamed airways and bronchoconstriction in asthma. Airways narrowed as a result of the inflammatory response cause wheezing.</p>
                        <p>During an asthma episode, inflamed airways react to environmental triggers such as smoke, dust, or pollen. The airways constrict   and produce excess mucus, making it difficult to breathe. In essence, asthma is the result of an immune response in the bronchial airways.</p>
                        <p>Attacks  can  be  prevented  by  avoiding  triggering  factors  and  by  drug  treatment.</p>
                        <p>Drugs are used for acute attacks, commonly inhaled beta-2 agonists. In more serious cases, drugs are used for long-term prevention, starting with inhaled corticosteroids, and then long-acting ß2-agonists if necessary. Leukotriene antagonists are less effective than corticosteroids but have no side effects. Therefore leukotriene antagonists,like montelukast,  are  used  as  maintenance  therapy.</p>
                        <h2 class="underline">Co-relation between Allergic Rhinitis and  Asthma</h2>
                        <p>Allergic rhinitis has been recognized as a risk factor for asthma; between 20% and 38% of patients who have allergic rhinitis have coexisting asthma</p>
                        <p>Asthma and allergic rhinitis (AR) are highly prevalent diseases that frequently occur as comorbid conditions. Clinical symptoms of asthma and AR may represent local manifestations of a single inflammatory disorder as both diseases share a common pathology  and  are  characterized  by  similar  inflammatory  cells.</p>

                        <p><b>Urticaria -</b> is sudden eruption of transitory, itchy wheals of various size and shape and is  marked  by  wheal  &  flare  reaction.</p>
                        <p><b>Wheals -</b> are flat, pale red elevations, surrounded by erythema, They develop within minutes and disappear within 24 hours without persistent skin  changes  (vary  from  0.2  to  10  cm)</p>
                        <p><b>Flare -</b> is  a  diffuse  area  of  redness  around  the  wheal.</p>

                            <li>Acute episodes of urticaria are arbitrarily defined as those lasting less than 6 weeks. More prolonged episodes are defined as chronic.</li>
                            <li>Urticaria could be caused by following agents:</li>
                            <p><b>Food Allergy:</b> Eggs, shell fish, nuts, milk, chocolate, citrus fruits, tomatoes, fish, food dyes,  etc</p>

                            <p><b>Insect  Stings  or  bites:</b>  Bee,  wasp,  etc</p>
                            <li>Although urticaria can be caused by any of the factor mentioned above, it is said it is difficult to identify the cause of urticaria in about 70% of cases - These cases are called Idiopathic urticaria. Most of these cases are chronic, hence the term chronic idiopathic urticaria. Needless to say chronic idiopathic urticaria is the most common  form  of  urticaria.</li>
                            <li>Degranulation of cutaneous mast cells is thought to be the most frequent cause of disease. Mast cells are found in large quantity within the subcutaneous tissues and dermis. They are present in large quantity surrounding the blood vessels.</li>
                            <li>When they are activated by any of a number of stimuli, these cells release mediators like histamine that increase the permeability of the capillaries and also synthesize various mediators.</li>

                            <li>Allergic contact dermatitis is due to allergies to metals like nickel, cosmetics, even sometimes  to  topical  medications.</li>
                            <li>Symptoms  are  itching,  redness  in  the  area  of  contact.</li>
                            <li>Besides avoidance   of  allergens   antihistamines  are used    to  provide symptomatic  relief.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2>Treatment of Allergic Disorders:</h2>
                        <p>The objectives in managing a patient with allergic disorder are to prevent or relieve symptoms  of  allergy  &  improve  quality  of  life.</p>
                        <h2>Following  measures  can  be  taken  to  treat  allergic  disorders:</h2>
                        <h2>1.  Allergen avoidance:</h2>
                        <p>Identification and avoidance of the causative allergen, if possible. Environmental  control measures to eliminate or reduce exposure to allergens are fundamental  to  the  management  of  allergic  disorders.</p>
                        <h2>2.  Pharmacotherapy:</h2>
                        <p>a)   Antihistamines  -  Drugs  which  block  the  action  of  released  histamine</p>
                        <p>b)   Decongestants - For relieving nasal congestion in patients with allergic rhinitis. Usually they are used in combination with an antihistaminic agent.</p>
                        <p>c)   Corticosteroids (Steroids) - Oral, topical (for skin allergy) or intranasal (for severe allergic rhinitis). Corticosteroids have anti-inflammatory action. Since long term use of corticosteroids is associated with multiple side effects, they are usually used only  for  short  term  in  severe  cases  of  allergy.</p>
                        <h2>3.  Allergy Immunotherapy</h2>
                        <p>Allergy immunotherapy is a preventive treatment for allergic reactions to substances such as grass pollens, house dust mites and bee venom. Immunotherapy involves giving gradually increasing doses of the substance, or allergen, to which the person is allergic. The incremental increases of the allergen cause the immune system to become less sensitive to the substance, by causing production of a "blocking" antibody, which reduces the symptoms of allergy when the substance is encountered in  the  future.</p>
                        <p>Allergy immunotherapy is not widely used in management of allergic disorders as it is time  - consuming  and  expensive.</p>
                        <p>In clinical practice, It is very difficult to either Identify the causative allergen or to avoid it. Hence, the only option left is to relieve the symptoms of allergy with the help of drugs.</p>
                        <h2 class="underline">Antihistamines (H1 Receptor antagonists):</h2>
                        <p>Since histamine is one of the most important chemical responsible for the signs and symptoms of allergy, drugs which block the actions of released histamines i.e. Antihistamines (H1 Receptor Antagonists) are the preferred drugs for treatment of allergy.</p>
                        <p>In peripheral tissues, histamine is stored in mast cells (large granulated cells found in the lymph nodes, the skin and in mucous membranes such as those in the gut and lung linings) and basophils.</p>
                        <p>After mast cell degranulation, released histamine binds with histamine receptors (H1 receptors) (Ref. Fig.5) and leads to various well-known symptoms of allergic conditions in the skin and in respiratory system as described below:</p>
                        <p>1.    Itching and pain due to irritation of sensory nerve endings.</p>
                        <p>2.   Redness,  swelling  and  edema  due  to  vasodilatation  and  increased  capillary permeability.</p>

                        <p>Antihistamines are the first-line drugs for the management of allergic disorders like allergic rhinitis and urticaria. Antihistamines compete with histamine for H1 receptors.</p>
                        <p>They block the binding of histamine to the H1 receptors and thus relieve most of  the  symptoms  associated  with  allergic  rhinitis  and  urticaria.</p>

                        <p>Unlike steroids, Antihistamines can be safely used for long term, without any adverse effects on bones, liver, kidney or the heart. Second generation Antihistamines are safe and very well tolerated by adults and children.</p>

                        <h2>Fexofenadine : Drug Profile</h2>
                        <h2 class="underline">Introduction:</h2>
                        <p>Fexofenadine is one of the most widely used second generation, non-sedating anti- histaminic  drug.</p>
                        <p>It is a highly effective, safe and well tolerated anti-histaminic agent for the treatment of respiratory and skin allergic disorders. Fexofenadine therapy provides prompt and sustained relief from symptoms of allergy with once daily dose. It has been approved for use  in  adults  as  well  as  children.  (Refer Table  4.of  classification)</p>
                        <h2 class="underline">Mechanism of action:</h2>
                        <p>1.   Fexofenadine is a highly selective peripheral H1 receptor antagonist.</p>
                        <p>2.   Block the peripheral H1 receptors in the skin and respiratory tract, fexofenadine blocks the unwanted effects of histamine in the body. This results in relief from symptoms  of  allergy  such  as  itching,  sneezing,  running  nose  etc.</p>
                        <p>3.   It  starts  acting  within  an  hour  of  administration  and  its  peak  effect  is  seen  at 2-3 hours.</p>
                        <p>4.   Long term use of fexofenadine is not associated with development of tolerance.</p>
                        <p>5.    Fexofenadine does not cross the blood-brain barrier, and does not produce drowsiness or sedation.</p>
                        <p>6.   Fexofenadine does not block cholinergic receptors and hence does not produce side effects  Iike  dryness  of  mouth  or  constipation.  Fexofenadine  also  does  not block alpha-1  receptors.  (ref. Table  4.  of  classification  table)</p>

                        <h2 class="underline">Absorption:</h2>
                        <p>After oral administration, fexofenadine is rapidly absorbed from the Gl tract and its absolute bio-availability is 33%.</p>
                        <p>Food does  not  alter  the  absorption  of  fexofenadine.</p>
                        <p>Peak serum concentrations are reached within 1-3 hours.</p>
                        <h2 class="underline">Distribution:</h2>
                        <p>Fexofenadine has a plasma protein binding capacity of 60-75%. Peak serum concentrations achieved with single doses of fexofenadine are as follows:</p>
                        <p>60  mg  dose  :  142  ng/ml</p>
                        <p>120  mg  dose  :  289  ng/ml</p>
                        <p>180  mg  dose  :  494  ng/ml</p>
                        <h2 class="underline">Metabolism:</h2>
                        <p>Only about 5% of the administered dose of fexofenadine gets metabolized in the liver.</p>
                        <h2 class="underline">Elimination:</h2>
                        <p>80% is excreted in faeces and 11.5% is excreted in urine. Its elimination half-life is 11-16 hours  (14.4  hrs.)</p>
                        <h2 class="underline">Approved Indications:</h2>
                        <p>1.   Allergic rhinitis</p>

                        <p>Adults and children over 12 years    60 mg twice daily or 120 mg-180 mg once daily</p>
                        <p>No dosage adjustment is required in the elderly, hepatically or renally impaired patients</p>
                        <h2 class="underline">Adverse effects:</h2>
                        <ul class="fist-menu second-menu">
                            <li>Fexofenadine is generally very well tolerated by children, adults as well as elderly.</li>
                            <li>Occasional patients may complain of headache, dizziness, fatigue or nausea.</li>
                            <li>Fexofenadine therapy does not produce drowsiness or sedation.</li>
                            <li>It also  does  not  have  any  adverse  effects  on  psychomotor  functions.</li>
                            <li>Fexofenadine is unlikely to produce an adverse effect on the ability to drive or use machines.</li>
                            <li>Studies  have  demonstrated  that  high  doses  of  fexofenadine,  do  not  prolong QT-interval and hence can be safely used in patients with cardiac disorders.</li>

                        <h2 class="underline">Drug Interactions:</h2>
                        <p>Since fexofenadine is not metabolized in liver, it is unlikely to interact with other drugs. No adverse drug-drug interactions when fexofenadine was co-administered with erythromycin, ketoconazole or omeprazole.</p>
                        <p>Aluminum and magnesium containing antacids may decrease the absorption and bio- availability of fexofenadine.</p>

                        <h2>LEVOCETIRIZINE</h2>
                        <p>Levocetirizine (R-cetirizine) is the active enantiomer of cetirizine. Some drugs come in two forms called enantiomers. The Enantiomers are mirror images of such other. They are termed as right handed or left handed based on their geometry. One of the enantiomer is responsible for activity, when both forms of enantiomers are present in a  drug,  the  drug  is  said  to  be  racemic  mixture  or  racemate.</p>
                        <p>The enantiomers of racemic drugs are described as R&S form or Levo and Dextro form. Enantiomers often exhibit different pharmacokinetic properties. Cetirizine is a racemic mixture of S- and R-enantiomers. The R-enantiomer, Levocetirizine has the antihistamine properties.</p>
                        <h2 class="underline">Absorption</h2>
                        <p>Levocetirizine is rapidly and extensively absorbed following oral administration. The bioavailability is about 85%. The peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of Levocetirizine is achieved in 0.5 to 1.5 hours (Faster concentrations leads to rapid onset of action). The  mean  peak  plasma  concentrations  are  0.27  ±  mcg/ml  after  a  dose  of  5 mg.</p>
                        <h2 class="underline">Distribution</h2>
                        <p>Levocetirizine and its metabolites are poorly distributed. The protein binding of the drug is 96.1%. The mean volume of distribution of Levocetirizine is much lesser than that of Cetirizine (0.3 l compare with 0.4-0.5 l). The drugs having a low volume of distribution have several advantages.</p>
                        <ul class="fist-menu">
                            <li>They have minimal inter-individual variation in the therapeutic effect</li>
                            <li>No  accumulation  in heart  or  liver,</li>
                            <li>A reduction in unwanted drug-drug interactions.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>For an H1 antagonist like Levocetirizine a small volume of distribution is considered a  positive  aspect  both  in  terms  of  efficacy  and  safety.</p>
                        <h2 class="underline">Metabolism</h2>
                        <p>Levocetirizine  is  poorly  metabolized.  The  cumulative  48  hours  excretion  of  the parent compound accounts for about 85% of the oral dose. At least 13 minor metabolites are detected in the urine. The metabolic pathways are oxidation, glucuroconjugation etc. The metabolites are O-glucuronide, a hydroxyl derivative of levocetirizine etc.</p>
                        <h2 class="underline">Excretion</h2>
                        <p>Levocetirizine is eliminated by renal excretion to a large extent. Metabolism is a minor route of elimination. The mean plasma half life of Levocetirizine is 7 hours. The dosage has to  be  modified  in  patients  with  renal  impairment.</p>
                        <h2 class="underline">Indications</h2>
                        <p>The preparation is recommended for the treatment of symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis, perennial allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria.</p>
                        <h2 class="underline">Dosage and Administration</h2>
                        <p>Adults  and  Children  6-12  years:  One  5 mg  tablet  once  daily.</p>
                        <h2 class="underline">Contraindications</h2>
                        <p>Levocetirizine is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment, hypersensitivity to Levocetirizine, piperazine derivatives or to any ingredient in the formulation. For Levocetirizine no data on exposed human pregnancy is available. Hence it should be used in pregnancy only when the benefits to the mother outweigh the risk to the fetus. There are no adequate and well controlled studies of Cetirizine in pregnant women. Because animal studies are not always predictive of human responses. Cetirizine should be used in pregnancy only if clearly needed. Use of Levocetirizine in lactating women is not  recommended  as  it  is  expected  to  be  excreted  in  breast  milk.</p>
                        <h2 class="underline">Precautions</h2>
                        <p>Caution is recommended with the intake of alcohol. Although there is no evidence, at the recommended dose, that Levocetirizine impairs mental alertness, reactivity or the ability to drive, patients intending to drive should not exceed the recommended dose and should take their responses into account.</p>
                        <h2 class="underline">Adverse Effects</h2>
                        <p>The incidence of adverse effects is mild to moderate. In trials, the incidence of adverse events in excess of placebo was 3%, while the discontinuation rate was less than 1% and not different to placebo. Levocetirizine has been shown not to impair mental alertness, reaction times or the ability to drive. The side effects include dry mouth, somnolence, fatigue, etc. Withdrawal due to adverse drug reaction is 0.7% with Levocetirizine against 0.8% with placebo. Some of the antihistamines like Terfenadine or Astemizole may be associated with prolongation of QT interval (This is cardiovascular side effect. Q and T are waves of a cardiogram. QT interval denotes the ventricular contraction. Prolongation of QT interval denotes abnormalities of ventricular contraction). There is no data on effect of Levocetirizine on QT interval, but Cetirizine appears to be free of any  cardiovascular  side  effects. </p>
                        <h2 class="underline">Drug Interactions</h2>
                        <p>The extent of absorption of Levocetirizine is not reduce with food, although the rate of absorption is decreased. Co-administration with alcohol or other CNS depressants may have  depressant  effects  on  the  CNS  in  sensitive  patients.</p>

                        <h2>Levocetirizine</h2>
                        <p>Levocetirizine works by blocking histamine receptors. It does not prevent the actual release of histamine from mast cells, but prevents its binding to its receptors. This in turn prevents the release of other allergy chemicals and increased blood supply to the area and also provides relief from the typical symptoms of allergic rhinitis. (for Levocetirizine details please refer Lazine)</p>
                        <h2>Montelukast</h2>
                        <p>Montelukast sodium is a selective and orally-active leukotriene-receptor antagonist (LTRA) that inhibits the cysteinyl leukotriene 1 (CysLT1) receptor. Montelukast is an effective and well-tolerated preventative treatment for asthma and allergic rhinitis in adults and children. The upper and lower airway show similar inflammatory responses to allergen challenge. Leukotrienes are inflammatory mediators that are known as the slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis produced by a number of cell types including mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, macrophages and monocytes.</p>
                        <p>Montelukast inhibits these actions by blocking type 1 CysLT receptors found on immunocytes, smooth muscle and endothelium in the respiratory mucosa. Initially developed as a treatment for asthma, montelukast has more recently found use in the  treatment  of  allergic  rhinitis  (AR).</p>
                        <p>Clinical trials have shown that montelukast is effective and safe in the treatment of patients with asthma, allergic rhinitis or both diseases.</p>
                        <h2>Pharmacokinetics of Montelukast:</h2>
                        <h2 class="underline">Absorption</h2>
                        <p>Montelukast is rapidly absorbed following oral administration.</p>
                        <p>Peak montelukast plasma concentration (Cmax) is achieved in 3 to 4 hours (Tmax).</p>
                        <p>Oral bioavailability is 64%. The oral bioavailability and Cmax are not influenced by a  standard  meal  in  the  morning.</p>
                        <h2 class="underline">Distribution</h2>
                        <p>More than 99% bound to plasma proteins. The steady state volume of distribution of montelukast  averages  8  to  11  liters.</p>
                        <h2 class="underline">Metabolism</h2>
                        <p>Montelukast is extensively metabolized. In studies with therapeutic doses, plasma concentrations of metabolites of montelukast are undetectable at steady state in adults and pediatric patients.</p>
                        <h2 class="underline">Elimination</h2>
                        <p>The plasma clearance of montelukast averages 45 mL/min in healthy adults. Following an oral dose of radiolabeled montelukast, 86% of the radioactivity was recovered in 5-day fecal collections and < 0.2% was recovered in urine. Coupled with estimates of montelukast oral bioavailability, this indicates that montelukast and its metabolites are excreted almost exclusively via the bile.</p>
                        <p>In several studies, the mean plasma half-life of montelukast ranged from 2.7 to 5.5 hours in healthy young adults. The pharmacokinetics of montelukast are nearly linear for  oral  doses  up  to  50  mg.</p>
                        <p>Montelukast, a novel medication, is an antagonist to the leukotriene receptor. It is nonsedating, dosed once daily and has a safety profile similar in adults and children with approval down to 6 months of age. Its benefits are equivalent to antihistamines, when used as monotherapy, but less than intranasal corticosteroids. The addition of an antihistamine to montelukast does appear to have added benefits and at times is reported to be equivalent to intranasal corticosteroids.</p>
